the commercial activity of providing funds and capital,"Is it a bad time to sell a condo in orange county , ca ? Prices in OC are increasing , but the volume of home sales is down . In November I bought a condo that was listed for 2 days , now 3 in my complex have been on the market for over 45 days . However the place I bought was listed $ 50,000 less then the same model listed by another agent . By the time the bidding war was over I paid $ 10K more then the asking price , the other unit for sale was thrashed and sold a month after mine for $ 5000 less then I paid . Best way to sell quick is to price VERY LOW , it will get the attention of all buyers looking in your area . You dont have to accept full price offers . If you have a good agent they will bluff any single offers . I have no way of verifying there was ever a bidding war on my condo , just that the sellers agent says he had 3 full price offers . My mom was my realtor , I had 20 % down payment , no home to sell , no contingencies , and I worked for a loan company . I also put a $ 20,000 deposit . In all actuality I doubt a better buyer was making an offer . Rates are going up and people will spend more to borrow the same amount , lowering the amount they can afford . If a lot of renters occupy your condo complex it may prove a good time to sell . The owners of rental properties will let investment properties go into foreclosure before they let a primary residence default . Are you moving up , or relocating ? Do you owe alot or have equity in your home ? The market is stable , but I know alot of people in over thier heads .

the commercial activity of providing funds and capital,"Recruiter or a phony ? Is it strange that a recruiter calls me up saying he knows of an open position in a company and yet , when I check out the careers section on the company 's website , not a single open position is listed ? Secondly , he calls my cell phone , but his number does n't pop up on the LCD ; it says `` Private Number '' . Does that sound normal ? And third , he being a third party recruiter , has been retained by the company to look for potential candidates like me , that 's what he told me . But yet , his email address is a mere AOL domain . Should n't his email address reflect the domain name of the company ? Are all these red flags of a fake or do I just not know how recruiters work and this guy may be for real ? If he 's a fake , is there a way to report him ? Thanks . These days , there are lots of third party recruiters who work independently on behalf of companies . There are also lots of scam artists . Before you meet him or even send him your resume , ask him to give you a letter from the company stating that he is working on their behalf.By the way , sometimes companies hire third party recruiters so they do n't have to list the opening on their website . They may not want the world to know about the search , or even their own employees . A good third party recruiter will have their own company email address and a good phone number to their business , but many are out their on their own .

Now bank informs us of loan that needs to be paid . Attorney says no bankruptcy was filed -- he 's keeping the fees . Bank wants life insurance policy for loan . Can they take life insurance to pay for loan ? What about other creditors ? We need to know -- we had to pay all funeral expenses and would like to be able to be reimbursed for that from life insurance policy.Thanks If the life insurance named a beneficiary , then the policy is a contract between the insured and the insurer and the bank is not allowed by law to intervene in that and therefore they are not entitled to the money.If the money was left to an estate , then the bank could make a claim against the estate and get some money for the car loan that way . Once the estate 's bills are paid off , then the remaining money can be divided among the heirs.The bank itself may have purchased its own policy on the car with themselves as beneficiary . This is called BOLI or bank owned life insurance . It is very common.Just the same the way the bank ca n't get the life insurance if they are not the beneficiary , you ca n't get 'reimbursed ' for the funeral expenses if you are not named the beneficiary.Only the named beneficiary can decide IF they want to pay the funeral expenses .

Please give ur opinions with relevant reasons to support urselves.. `` ur experiences with God '' are also welcome.. Thanks ! ! = ) Of course there is some question of , `` Why are we here ? '' and the `` Meaning of life ? '' I believe strongly in God . I believe he sent his son down to earth to die for my sins , your sins , and everyone sins . Jesus , bridges the gap between God and us that was separated when Adam and Eve first turn their backs on him in the Garden of Eden . Sacrificing something pure , like a lamb , then was the gap filled . But then Jesus came , a pure being , God ’ s only son , he was like the lamb , pure and without sin , sacrificed for our sins to fill the gap between God and us . Believing in Jesus and accepting him into our lives fill that gap to God and we have access to eternal life . God is so significant in my life . My mother was taken from me at 12 years old by ovarian cancer . I didn ’ t think God cared . Later I experienced trials of my faith . I grew to learn that there is a purpose to everything and that everything happens for a reason . Everything happens for the best . One certain case , I believe , would be that an angel of the Lord confronted me . I had had some troubles at home and I stormed off to my school . I sat there on the swing sets looking down at the ground . I noticed the school was completely empty . I can not recall any sound of the highway that could be heard very clearly near by . Then I noticed a young woman with blonde hair . She was pushing a baby in a stroller . She had been walking around the track and soon came to the playground , which I had been the whole time . She slowly approached and asked if I was all right . Of course , I said yes , trying to shrug her off . She asked me if I knew about Jesus . I thought that she saw it was a perfect opportunity to preach about Jesus and God . I already knew all that stuff , I told her I knew him and told her my father is involved with the church . She smiled and said that that was nice . She then said something I will never forget . She said with a smile on her face , “ Alright , just know that He loves you and knows that you are upset. ” I smiled , thinking that she was being nice . She started walking away and she said , “ Nice talking to you , Michael. ” She walked away towards the surrounding school buildings . I then realized , I never mentioned my name . I didn ’ t even know her . In a small community , I had never seen her before . I then got on my bike and rode to the building to talk again with her . She had gone past the building very shortly before I arrived there on my bike . I turned the corner and she wasn ’ t there . It was physically impossible to get out of the school that fast , especially with a baby . I was then filled with a great sense of power and strength . It was a great feeling . I rode my bike home faster than ever . I was crying all the way home.I have told this story to only a few people . I never expected people to believe me ; I could care less if they didn ’ t . I believe what happened . I was there . That helped incidence helped me so much . I felt much better after that . Today , I still have problems . I am human . But I can always turn to Jesus for help . I believe in him by Faith , and Faith alone . That is all you need to attain salvation ! Faith.I hope you understand to that God loves you . God Bless You !

the commercial activity of providing funds and capital,"Can any business legally change the price of its offering based on the demand ( like Airline companies ) ? Generally , yes . There are exceptions though.One of the principles behind capitalism is that buyers and sellers are able to freely make decisions about whether to buy or sell , and at what price . If a seller raises his price , buyers should be able to buy less , or buy from someone else.If a company has a monopoly , then the buyers have no choice about where to buy . So there are laws and regulations about how monopolies can behave . Examples of monopolies include power companies , and cable companies.Sometimes in natural disasters , some sellers take advantage of the situation to raise prices of things like gas or water by huge amounts . While some may argue that this is the principle of free markets , others feel that this is unfair to disaster victims who have no other options . So there are `` price gouging '' laws in some places that forbid this kind of thing.And then there 's price fixing , which means communicating with your competitors and raising prices together . Again , this is seen as unfair , and so is illegal . Some of the airlines were guilty of this a long time ago.There are some other minor restrictions on pricing , but for the most part , aside from doing these things that are considered grossly unfair , businesses are generally free to price however they want ."

the commercial activity of providing funds and capital,"I just bought my first home and i want to rent it ? where do i get a free rental agreement . I have no idea what they say or anything . It 's my first home . Did you sign an occupancy affidavit at the closing ? Do not use a `` free '' rental agreement or one of those standard forms from Staples or whatever . I could tell you hundreds of horror stories from people who used those agreements and screwed themself royally . Same thing with deciding to be a landlord when you know absolutely nothing about it.Do yourself a great big favor . Make an appointment with the top landlord/tenant lawyer in your area . Make sure that is their specialty . Pay them to do a lease that is specific for your area and your needs . Have them give you a crash course on local landlord/tenant law and how it applies to you and your proposed situation . The $ 100 to $ 200 it costs you now could save you thousands and thousands in the end.A true horror story from my office : Woman rents out her condo when she is transferred . She buys a `` legal '' lease from one of those landlord sites and uses it . A year later , she decides to sell the condo and make some serious money while the market is hot . This way she can buy a new place where she now lives , pay cash and have a huge chunk of change left over.She gives the tenants 30 days notice a month before their lease is up . The tenants say they are n't going anywhere . So , she comes to our office to evict them . We tell her `` Sorry , but your tenant does n't ever have to leave if they do n't want to as long as they pay their rent because 1 ) in this county , if you rent a condo to someone , it must state in big bold letters at the top that it is a condo and subject to sale or else you are required to give them a 2 YEAR notice if you are ending their tenancy if you want to sell the place , 2 ) leases in this state automatically renew themselves on a month to month basis and you do n't have a right to evict simply because a lease is ending under the anti-eviction act of this state and 3 ) this $ 9.99 bargain of a lease does not contain the all-important `` right of re-entry '' clause needed in order to evict for cause in this state , so the fact that you did n't tell them in the lease that it is a condo does n't even really matter at this point . They do n't ever have to leave even if they did give you cause to evict . `` She 's hysterical because prices more than doubled in the past year . Her 150K condo is under contract for 320K , and now she ca n't sell it because of this . She wants to sue the online landlord site because they told her the lease is `` perfectly legal '' . We have to tell her she does n't have a case because ... the lease is perfectly legal , it 's just not in her best interests . Do n't be a schmuck over $ 100 to $ 200 . Pay a professional for their expertise and advice ."

Note in your petition how many overnights you have , and document the money that you are already paying her . Get receipts , bank statements , etc . Probably like most human beings who do n't live with a lawyer by their side doing running commentary , you did n't get receipts from her , but gather up all the witnesses you can .

the commercial activity of providing funds and capital,"Stock Price Charts ? What is the purpose of having the price charted on logarthmic paper ? ? Logarithmic charts are used for long-term charts.Let 's take the Dow Jones Industrial Average as an example . It 's currently trading around 11000 or so.If we have a look at the Dow back to say 1940 ( the dow was at 150 ) , the start of the chart looks like almost a flat line from 1940 to 1955 . The Dow actually rows to almost 500 in 1955.The problem with a linear scale is that takes the maximum levels into account . So a rise from 150 to 500 ( a three folder increase ) looks insignificant compared to the period between 1990 ( dow was around 2700 ) to 1998 ( when the dow got to over 9000 , yet they are both dramatic movements.So by using a log/semilog scale we can compare the relative price movements rather than the physical point changes.So , a 3 fold increase looks the same whether the it 's from 150 to 450 or 2700 to 8100.See the sources below for charts of the Dow showing the two different pricing scales ."

the commercial activity of providing funds and capital,"what is the difference between brand name and trade mark ? A Brand Name is simply the name of a company , product , service , or combination of these . ( e.g . Coke , Chevrolet , IBM , Jelly Belly , etc . ) If you want to get technical , you can also have `` Sub-brands '' like Cherry Coke , Diet Coke , etc.A TradeMark is something entirely different . It 's simply a legally protected word or phrase , used to `` protect '' that word or phrase . Typically protection only applies within a specific business category ( e.g . beverages ) and within a specific country . The protection prevents others in the industry from using the same phrase . Examples of things that may bear a trademark are brand names , taglines ( `` The choice of a new generation '' ) , or the names of sub-brands or specific services : `` McGriddle '' . It 's also possible to trademark sounds ( the ABC tones , the sound of a Harley Davidson engine ) and logos ( but sometimes with limited success - Harley Davidson was not successful . - the sound was deemed too generic and therefore `` not ownable '' . ) Do n't confuse TM with Copyright - A copyright is obtained by registering an entire text , song , or other full proprietary creation like a book , article , lyrics , etc ."

a machine for performing calculations automatically,"What is the largest LCD Monitor I could use effectively using 3D Max ? I was looking into the Viewsonic n2750w 27 '' HDTV that actually was on G4 TV as a good gaming monitor . I was under the understanding that too big can make computer `` graphics '' blurry . One of the most important factors , that nobody else ever seems to care about ( and it pisses me off to no end ) , is the RESOLUTION of the monitor . And I 've never seen an LCD tv that has a resolution higher than 1280*1024 ( an `` amazing '' performance , achieved in the last millennium by over 99 % of the common 17 '' CRT monitors and many 15 '' monitors too ) .The 27 '' beast you mention makes no exception ; its resolution is even lower : 1280*720 . My Viewsonic VA1912w ( 19 '' ) already beats it ( 1440*900 ) and my ( older ) 19 '' CRT totally humiliates it ( 1600*1200 ) . Even my 15 '' laptop screen has 1400*1050.What this means ( having a HUGE monitor with a low resolution ) is that you wo n't have more pixels on the screen ( actually , you 'll probably have less ) , but the pixels will be larger.Just like zooming into a low-resolution image . It gets bigger but it does n't look any better.Now , 1280*1024 is plenty enough for TV ( and HDTV ) , so that display is perfectly good for watching TV , from a comfortable distance . And this is the key : it is a TV , not a computer monitor ! It 's probably good enough for games too , because games do n't need very high resolutions . What matters for games is the low latency for fast and impressive action.However , if you want to do serious graphics , do n't settle for anything less than 1600*1200 . It 's just not worth it . And you can find that resolution ( or higher ) in LCD monitors ( not TVs ! ) starting from 20 '' ."

McAfee like most virus scanners should have a small icon in the system tray that shows if it 's active , usually it 's red if everything is active and running fine and black if something 's not active . If you do n't have this icon in the system tray ( bottom right of the screen ) then you may want to check your running processes by pressing `` ctrl + alt + del '' once and looking for the McAfee processes under the processes tab .

a machine for performing calculations automatically,"What is Microsoft Excel ( xls ) ? Excel is the spreadsheet that comes with Microsoft Office.A spreadsheet is , at its most basic , a grid of boxes where you can enter numbers and equations . Each box ( called a cell ) has a specific address , based on the row number and the column . The first cell is A1 , the one below it is A2 , and the one to the right of it is B1 . Pretty simple so far , right ? Knowing no more than this , you can use Excel as nothing more than a convenient editor for tabular data . In fact , this is primarily what Excel is for ... except instead of just putting in tabular data it can also calculate the data for you.Here 's an example : I had a garage sale recently and recorded each sale in the spreadsheet . It was pretty simple . ( Actually , I 'm lying to you . It was a complex spreadsheet that tracked a lot of different things like donor , category , and sales goals , but I 'm simplifying it for this answer . It COULD have been a simple spreadsheet ) . In the 'A ' column I listed the item that was sold . In the B column I listed the price of the item . A ways down the B column -- say row 100 -- I put an equation in by typing `` =sum ( B1 : B99 ) '' which meant to add up all the numbers in the cells from B1 to B99 . Now I had a functional spreadsheet that automatically updated the total sold so far . Any time I typed in a new purchase , BAM ! There was the new total . A lot easier than adding it up on paper , no ? This is basically what a spreadsheet is . It can format numbers as percentages , dollar amounts , etc . Basic math works like `` =A5+B6 '' or `` =C12+10 '' and so forth -- each cell 's address can be treated as a variable in the equation , and you can type in literal numbers as well.. The more common equations ( average , total , etc ) have buttons for them on the top . For the more advanced ones I usually recommend choosing `` function '' from the insert menu.You 'd be surprised what excel can do . It 's pretty simple on the surface , but has tremendous power beneath . I hope this answered your question . Good luck to you ."

a machine for performing calculations automatically,"what is active directory ? LDAP ( Lightweight Directory Access Protocol ) is a software protocol for enabling anyone to locate organizations , individuals , and other resources such as files and devices in a network , whether on the public Internet or on a corporate intranet . LDAP is a `` lightweight '' ( smaller amount of code ) version of Directory Access Protocol ( DAP ) , which is part of X.500 , a standard for directory services in a network . LDAP is lighter because in its initial version it did not include security features . LDAP originated at the University of Michigan and has been endorsed by at least 40 companies . Netscape includes it in its latest Communicator suite of products . Microsoft includes it as part of what it calls Active Directory in a number of products including Outlook Express . Novell 's NetWare Directory Services interoperates with LDAP . Cisco also supports it in its networking products . In a network , a directory tells you where in the network something is located . On TCP/IP networks ( including the Internet ) , the domain name system ( DNS ) is the directory system used to relate the domain name to a specific network address ( a unique location on the network ) . However , you may not know the domain name . LDAP allows you to search for an individual without knowing where they 're located ( although additional information will help with the search ) ."

knowledge acquired by learning and instruction,"who is nicodeums and herodias from the new testament ? There was a man of the Pharisees , named Nicodemus , a ruler of the Jews . Nicodemus is named three times by John , and not elsewhere ; here , in chapter 7:50 , where he protests against condemning Jesus unheard , and in chapter 19:39 , where he aids Joseph of Arimathæa , in the burial of Jesus . There are untrustworthy traditions about him and an allusion in the Jewish Talmud to a Nicodemus who lived about this time , but it may have been another man . Two facts are here stated : ( 1 ) That he was a Pharisee of the powerful , self-righteous sect which laid such stress on ceremonial observances and Jewish birth ; and ( 2 ) That he was a ruler , a member of the Sanhedrim , the congress of seventy persons who held the chief authority in Israel . The allusion to him in verse 10 as a `` teacher in Israel , '' would imply that he was one of the prominent doctors of the law.Herodias was the sister-in-law of the Herod who arrested John the Baptist .

knowledge acquired by learning and instruction,"Economics or Engineering ? I 'm starting my freshman year in the fall . Which would be better , considering job market , pay , competitiveness , and prestige and any other factors ? I 'm planning on following through with a masters degree in whichever major that I end up choosing . If you 're going on with a masters afterwards anyway , then I 'd say the Engineering will serve you better at the undergrad level , regardless of which direction you choose.I 'm just finishing my Ph.D. in Economics . When I was applying to grad schools , I was shocked to learn that the Econ grad programs actually give preference to undergrads with Engineering or Math majors OVER Economics majors . The reason for that is because grad programs in Economics today are heavily math-intensive , and they have observed that Engineering and Math undergrads tend to do better in the Econ programs.So , regardless of what you decide to do later , the Engineering major will be better for you . If you want to keep all your options open , do an Econ minor along with it . That way , you 've got another 3 1/2 years to decide which route you want to take . Good luck !"
knowledge acquired by learning and instruction,"Help how to study ? I have an upcoming exam of 6 subjects . ( 3 are major and big while 3 are minor but not so easy ) I have started studying but its taking a lot time to cover even a single topic . this is because i first read the topic from one book ( the one i like ) and then from the other book ( the one other students study ) and then i make my own essay note out of it so that i need not see my textbooks before exams and only the notes.what i am asking is opinion is it worth to make such comprehensive notes or should i just read the text and highlight it and wait till the exam night to read it again ? the second method wil definitely take less time but i wo n't have notes at the end ? what do u think . I believe the time consuming way is the better option . Highlighting would be okay if you looked it over every day rather than waiting until the end of the semester at exam time . I learned to study by taking notes during the reading or lectures . Rewriting them clearly the same day . Then each day look them over from start to what gets added each class . It does n't take long to scan over them daily and when it 's time for the test you do n't have to stress or even do anything more . It has already gotten into your head a little each day and having the structure of your notes repeated , your ability to recall specific facts will return in that same order .

knowledge acquired by learning and instruction,"please tell me effective ways on being the topnotcher in class aside from studying. ? Studying is a big part of being a top performer , but it 's not enough . You need to have the desire to learn ! For me , the easiest way to build this desire is to try to mentally apply all lessons to something in life outside of school . This worked for me with everything except algebra . For years I would ask `` why do I need to know this ? '' I never got any good answers until I was out of school for 9 years . The answer was quite simple ... Algebra teaches you to think ! I really wish I knew this when I was in school . I barely passed with a D in high school , and had to take Algebra 098 in college to get into other math.When you have a desire to learn , studying does n't really exist . You are on a quest for knowledge . You 'll often need to find more resources to fulfill your need to know . It 's a wonderful adventure , continuing your whole life , not ending when the last bell sounds in your senior year.Good luck , I hope you can build this desire !"

Are you planning to study at the CUNY Graduate Center or are you taking courses at one of CUNY 's braches -- e.g . Queens College , Brooklyn College , or City College ? Assuming that you will be at the Graduate Center , the institution is located in what used to be the B. Altman 's Department Store . They have modified the building , but have kept many of the landmark architectural touches . The Graduate Center library is of moderate size , but NYPL 's main research branch is about 7 blocks away . The faculty for the Graduate Center has a good reputation . Many come from other CUNY campuses . The other thing is that , as the name implies , the Graduate Center has graduate students only , so I guess that this would affect the atmosphere of the place , though I do not have extensive experience there . I have visited it a few times.If you are going to one of the branch campuses , they vary . Queens and Brooklyn , for instance have sizable campuses ( at least sizable for NYC ) . Hunter and Baruch are in Manhattan and are just buildings -- no green . Most of the branches have larger libraries than the Graduate Center , and I believe , as a CUNY student , you would have access to any of these libraries.I hope this helps ."

knowledge acquired by learning and instruction,"what is an encyclopaedia ? Encyclopedia or Encyclopaedia , reference work that provides information on a range of subjects . Encyclopedias can encompass many areas of interest , or they can focus on a particular field of study , such as a geographic area , an ethnic group , a time period , or an academic discipline . Most encyclopedias have hundreds or thousands of articles , each addressing a distinct topic . Many of the articles contain illustrations , maps , photographs , and other media elements that help readers understand concepts . For centuries encyclopedias were published as multivolume sets of books , but in the late 20th century they appeared in new formats , such as CD-ROM , digital video disc ( DVD ) , and on the Internet . The term encyclopedia comes from the Greek words enkyklios paideia , meaning “ comprehensive education ” and originally signifying instruction in all branches of knowledge , or a comprehensive education in a specific subject . This concept gave rise to the idea of collecting the materials for such instruction into a single work , in which the contents and relations of the various arts and sciences would be explained systematically . Attempts to produce books of this kind were made more than 2,000 years ago , although the name encyclopedia was not given to such works until the 16th century ."

I have already written , revised , and further revised , asked former teachers to help revise..and then rewrote again my personal statement . But I would still like to hear advice from any experts or knowledgable people 's advice about applying to both UC 's and private schools . Stress leadership . Stress initiative . Stress your individualism . Write concisely , and for God 's sakes do n't make spelling or grammatical mistakes ! Do n't spend too much time touting your academic achievements , unless they apply to your initiative and leadership ( they can see your grades elsewhere ) .They want to know you will succeed in College . And unlike high school , College is not some mandatory thing you have to go to ( or , conversely , are entitled to ) and the reviewers know it . The top schools are looking for kids who will work their butts off , who have a proven record of working their butts off , and who will continue to work their butts off to make the world a better place in the future . Who really has the potential to be the next leaders ? Who will use school for what it is - a stepping stone to greatness - rather than an end in itself ? If you take the attitude school is an end in itself , not part of a greater future , you diminish your chances ."

knowledge acquired by learning and instruction,"what is the origin of the english word lollygag ? As you have surmised to `` lollygag '' is to dawdle , fool around , and just generally do everything except what you should be doing . As a verb , `` lollygag '' ( or `` lallygag '' ) dates back to around 1869 , and a noun form , meaning `` nonsense '' or `` foolishness , '' showed up a bit earlier , around 1862 . Unfortunately , the origin of `` lollygag '' is unknown , but there are clues from which we may , perhaps , be able to extrapolate the roots of `` lollygag . '' ( `` Extrapolate '' in this context , by the way , is a fancy word for `` guess . '' ) First up in the batting order of possible `` lollygag '' clues is `` loll , '' which is a very old word originally meaning `` to droop or dangle . '' We use `` loll '' today to mean to relax or pass time idly , the sort of behavior that vacations are designed to encourage . There seems to be a plausible connection between this `` utterly relaxed '' meaning of `` loll '' and the `` wasting time '' sense of `` lollygag . '' Another bit of evidence might be found in the fact that `` to loll '' also means to let your tongue hang out , and that `` lolly '' is an English slang term for tongue ( quite possibly the source of the name of our friend the lollipop , by the way ) . Perhaps `` lollygagging '' arose from the perception that lazy lollygaggers were adept at exercising only one muscle -- their tongues ."

knowledge acquired by learning and instruction,"How does stienbeck prepare you for the idea that the death of Curley 's wife is inevitable ? Like the previous response , several instances of foreshadowing occur in Of Mice & Men . Lenny 's size , propensity toward petting/killing `` soft things '' , etc . are repeated and made very obvious . You could look at Curley 's wife in similar light . She is not unlike a small animal , somewhat lost in the world and affected by many forces beyond her control . She is also naive . The story about the movie offer and her blind belief that her mother derailed her chances of living her dream life support this idea . In addition , her physical `` beauty '' in contrast to the bleak scenery and lives of the many farmhands makes her almost otherworldly . The innocence conveyed by her angelic features and naivete qualifies her as unique and somewhat ethereal ( i.e.- too good for this world or life ) . Some might dispute this , based on her behavior toward the farmhands , but you should consider her background and desperate efforts to gain any form of attention available to a woman in her position . I think Steinbeck prepares you for her inevitable death ( and the peace she finds in death - see the description of her lying in the barn ) in both obvious and not-so-obvious ways . It 's all how you interpret what you 're given ."
knowledge acquired by learning and instruction,"who is assaf rosenblatt ? Is his `` answers engine '' in brainboost really a breakthru or is it just a new gimmick ? How is Brainboost different from existing engines like Google ? Brainboost is an answer engine whereas Google is a Search engine.What that means is that Brainboost actually finds answers to your questions posed in plain English as opposed to directing you to pages that simply mention the questions.Brainboost , Using the AnswerRank™ system , intelligently reads hundreds of web pages derived from search results and extracts just the short and concise answer to your question , saving you time.Following is a simplistic explanation showing the process of both engines Google * User types in : “ Why is mars red ” * Google Search engine retrieves all pages containing words `` mars '' and red '' . * Search results are sorted by the number of links each one of them got from other pages . This is a good way to figure out which one of them is most trusted by others . * Results are displayed with the snippet being the appearance of the question on the pages * Typically , a user would then click on the first search result , read through the document and hope to find an answer . * If an answer is not found within the first search result , the user needs to repeat this process with the next search result , sometimes having to read many web pages to finally get at the answer . Brainboost * User types in : “ Why is mars red ” * Brainboost translates the query into multiple queries that will raise the probability of finding the ANSWER to the question . * Brainboost retrieves search engine results . * Brainboost retrieves top several hundred pages and reads them . * Brainboost finds answers and ranks them based on it 's proprietary AnswerRank™ technology . AnswerRank™ knows to look at a set of many possible answers and rank them as to which one is probably the most correct . In this case : `` Mars is red because of the iron in the soil '' * Brainboost displays the ANSWERS to the userSo you see , Brainboost is a fundamentally different way to find knowledge . Whereas Search engines force you to spend time searching for that piece of information , Brainboost does that for you by automatically reading the search results and extracting the precious answer to your question.When you add up all time we spend plowing through search results for an answer , this functionality translates to hours of time saved.While search engines like MSN and Ask Jeeves have recently made limited attempts at answering questions from finite databases or precanned editorially collected answers , Brainboost is the only engine that leverages the full knowledge available on the web.Brainboost . It ’ s the next evolutionary step in search engines ."
knowledge acquired by learning and instruction,"Help asap ! ! ! ! ? my friend needs some ideas for an extended metaphor poem help ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Metaphors are very effective ways of developing ideas in poems ; one special form , the `` extended metaphor , '' can be particularly effective in certain situations . An extended metaphor is a comparison that provides the basis for an entire poem or for a lengthy section of a poem ; its value lies in keeping the reader 's attention focused on a single clear image while at the same time allowing the writer to develop a number of different aspects of an idea.For instance , look at `` The Hound '' by Robert Francis : Life the houndEquivocalComes at a boundEither to rend meOr to befriend me.I can not tellThe hound 's intentTill he has sprungAt my bare handWith teeth or tongue.Meanwhile I standAnd wait the event.The poem begins by equating `` life '' and `` the hound '' and creating a clear image of the dog running towards the speaker ( thereby giving tangible substance to the otherwise abstract `` life '' ) . The speaker can not determine the dog 's intention -- whether it will attack or warmly greet -- because its appearance is the same in either case . Only once things have progressed past the point where the speaker can effectively react does he learn which was the dog 's intention , so that all he can do is to wait in uncertainty to learn which it is to be . By grounding the entire poem in a single specific , concrete , commonplace occurence , Francis is able to generalize about `` life '' without resorting to vague abstractions.and this is what an extended metaphor basicly isA metaphor brought up in the beginning of the poem is lust being of evil desire holding an image of sweet pleasure and deception . Lust is described as perjured , which means to tell a lie . As the feeling of lust makes you think its something romanticized , it 's really not . Lust is also called `` Murderous , bloody , full of blame , /savage extreme rude , cruel , not to trust '' These descriptive words help the reader to understand that lust is to be blamed for caring a lie of emotions and feeling , during and before lust . In the poem , Shakespeare describes the desire `` a bliss in proof '' and then contradicts the statement by saying `` A very woe '' . The contradiction is carried through out the poem in following lines . In the middle of the sonnet , the speaker voices `` Past reason hunted '' meaning the lust we find ourselves searching for with feelings , similar to love . `` Past reason hated '' being the remembrance of regret for such lust and unfolding the lies of what you thought you were feeling . In conclusion , through out the poem , it 's this battle of pleasure possessing evil qualities and lust masking itself to be pleasurable . It 's a win , lose situation of emotions one must carry in one 's personal indulgences ."

knowledge acquired by learning and instruction,"What is a natural monopoly and why do they exist ? A natural monopoly is one that exists because of economies of scale rather than one created by a government to fill the need.Telephone companies , cable companies , et cetera are often local monopolies give sole license to operate within a city because the cost of deploying cables or wires to the home would be cost prohibitive for multiple companies to deploy , own and operated.Microsoft is like a natural monopoly , despite some of their practices that some deemed anti-competitive , they have had competitors for decades . For reasons of compatibility , operability , and cost , Microsoft became , for all intents and purposes , a monopoly because the consumers chose them by the product purchases they made . Consumers were always free to buy an Apple computer , DR-DOS , WordPerfect , and any of countless other products . However , they did n't because there was an economy of scale by being able to exchange Word and Excel documents , buy a computer from competing manufacturers which ran the same software , and purchase software written for Windows becuase it was too costly for the developers to write software for multiple platforms . Thus it was `` natural '' rather than being given sole license by any particular governing body such as the US Government.http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_monopoly"
knowledge acquired by learning and instruction,"i need inside information on the real life of J.D . Salinger ? particularly good info on the catcher in the rye . this is research for an english assignment . American novelist and short story writer . Salinger published one novel and several short story collections between 1948-59 . His best-known work is THE CATCHER IN THE RYE ( 1951 ) , a story about a rebellious teenage schoolboy and his quixotic experiences in New York . J.D . Salinger was born and grew up in the fashionable apartment district of Manhattan , New York . He was the son of a prosperous Jewish importer of Kosher cheese and his Scotch-Irish wife . In his childhood the young Jerome was called Sonny . The family had a beautiful apartment on Park Avenue . After restless studies in prep schools , he was sent to Valley Forge Military Academy ( 1934-36 ) , which he attended briefly . His friends from this period remember his sarcastic wit . In 1937 when he was eighteen and nineteen , Salinger spent five months in Europe . From 1937 to 1938 he studied at Ursinus College and New York University . He fell in love with Oona O'Neill , wrote her letters almost daily , and was later shocked when she married Charles Chaplin , who was much older than she . In 1939 Salinger took a class in short story writing at Columbia University under Whit Burnett , founder-editor of the Story Magazine . During World War II he was drafted into the infantry and was involved in the invasion of Normandy . Salinger 's comrades considered him very brave , a genuine hero . During the first months in Europe Salinger managed to write stories and in Paris meet Ernest Hemingway . He was also involved in one of the bloodiest episodes of the war in Hürtgenwald , a useless battle , where he witnessed the horrors of war . In his celebrated story 'For Esmé - With Love and Squalor ' Salinger depicted a fatigued American soldier . He starts a correspondence with a thirteen-year-old British girl , which helps him to get a grip of life again . Salinger himself was hospitalized for stress according to his biographer Ian Hamilton . After serving in the Army Signal Corps and Counter-Intelligence Corps from 1942 to 1946 , he devoted himself to writing . He played poker with other aspiring writers , but was considered a sour character who won all the time . He considered Hemingway and Steinbeck second rate writers but praised Melville . In 1945 Salinger married a French woman named Sylvia - she was a doctor . They were later divorced and in 1955 Salinger married Claire Douglas , the daughter of the British art critic Robert Langton Douglas . The marriage ended in divorce in 1967 , when Salinger 's retreat into his private world and Zen Buddhism only increased . Salinger 's early short stories appeared in such magazines as Story , where his first story was published in 1940 , Saturday Evening Post and Esquire , and then in the New Yorker , which published almost all of his later texts . In 1948 'A Perfect Day for Bananafish ' appeared , which introduced Seymour Glass , who commits suicide . It was the earliest reference to the Glass family , whose stories would go on to form the main corpus of his writing . The 'Glass cycle ' continued in the collections FRANNY AND ZOOEY ( 1961 ) , RAISE HIGH THE ROOF BEAM , CARPENTERS ( 1963 ) and SEYMOUR : AN INTRODUCTION ( 1963 ) . Several of the stories are narrated by Buddy Glass . 'Hapworth 16 , 1924 ' is written in the form of a letter from summer camp , in which the seven-year-old Seymour draws a portrait of him and his younger brother Buddy . `` When I look back , listen back , over the half-dozen or slightly more original poets we 've had in America , as well as the numerous talented eccentric poets and - in modern times , especially - the many gifted style deviates , I feel something close to a conviction that we have only three or four very nearly nonexpendable poets , and I think Seymour will eventually stand with those few .

What is the poet trying to communicate to the reader ? Thanks I think the answer might be in here ... Once upon a midnight dreary , while I pondered , weak and weary , Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore -- While I nodded , nearly napping , suddenly there came a tapping , As of some one gently rapping , rapping at my chamber door . `` 'T is some visitor , '' I muttered , `` tapping at my chamber door -- Only this , and nothing more . '' Ah , distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December ; And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor . Eagerly I wished the morrow ; -- vainly I had sought to borrow From my books surcease of sorrow -- sorrow for the lost Lenore -- For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore -- Nameless here for evermore . And the silken , sad , uncertain rustling of each purple curtain Thrilled me -- filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before ; So that now , to still the beating of my heart , I stood repeating , `` 'T is some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door -- Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door ; -- This it is , and nothing more . '' Presently my soul grew stronger ; hesitating then no longer , `` Sir , '' said I , `` or Madam , truly your forgiveness I implore ; But the fact is I was napping , and so gently you came rapping , And so faintly you came tapping , tapping at my chamber door , That I scarce was sure I heard you '' -- here I opened wide the door ; -- Darkness there , and nothing more . Deep into that darkness peering , long I stood there wondering , fearing , Doubting , dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before ; But the silence was unbroken , and the stillness gave no token , And the only word there spoken was the whispered word , `` Lenore ! '' This I whispered , and an echo murmured back the word , `` Lenore ! '' -- Merely this , and nothing more . Back into the chamber turning , all my soul within me burning , Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before . `` Surely , '' said I , `` surely that is something at my window lattice : Let me see , then , what thereat is , and this mystery explore -- Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore ; -- 'T is the wind and nothing more . '' Open here I flung the shutter , when , with many a flirt and flutter , In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore ; Not the least obeisance made he ; not a minute stopped or stayed he ; But , with mien of lord or lady , perched above my chamber door -- Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door -- Perched , and sat , and nothing more . Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling , By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore , `` Though thy crest be shorn and shaven , thou , '' I said , `` art sure no craven , Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore -- Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night 's Plutonian shore ! '' Quoth the Raven , `` Nevermore . '' Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly , Though its answer little meaning -- little relevancy bore ; For we can not help agreeing that no living human being Ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door -- Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door , With such name as `` Nevermore . '' But the Raven , sitting lonely on the placid bust , spoke only That one word , as if his soul in that one word he did outpour . Nothing further then he uttered -- not a feather then he fluttered -- Till I scarcely more than muttered , `` Other friends have flown before -- On the morrow he will leave me , as my Hopes have flown before . '' Then the bird said , `` Nevermore . '' Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken , `` Doubtless , '' said I , `` what it utters is its only stock and store , Caught from some unhappy master whom u"

I do n't understand the differences Acoustic guitars can not be plugged in . They have no electronics . Acoustic /Electric guitars look the same as Acoustic [ they are both hollow-bodied ] . The only difference is that Acoustic/Electrics can be plugged in . They have a jack and a small pickup which is not highly visible yet allows the instrument to be plugged into an amplifier which increases the volume of the instrument [ also allows electronic effects to be added to enhance sound quality during performance ] .

When I see cartoons on the TV , all human characters seem to have only four fingers . Why do the cartoonists draw them with only four fingers ? This trend actually started from Disney.Disney found out that eliminating one finger could give a more plastic movement to the figure 's hands.Also it is much more easy to draw because you have a less complexe pattern to follow within the limited space required for a cartoon 's hand . Then the trend was passed on from Disney to other creators of the era including the great Osamu Tezuka who made his astro-boy character with four fingers only.Suprisingly it worked so well that even today 's characters such as the simpsons have one finger less !"

He let American think he made this song his own and the Judges commended him for `` being himself '' What are your thoughts and opinions ? I never heard it said that it was Chris ' own arrangement of the song . I do n't think that Chris tried to pass it off as his own arrangement because just the week before he gave proper credit to the Red Hot Chili Peppers for doing a similar version of `` Higher Ground '' . The judges just said that he knows what songs are right for his voice . There has been speculation as to whether Chris mentioned Live 's version in the pre-performance monologue and that it was edited out . I think it is getting completely blown out of proportion and I hope it does n't hurt Chris ' chances . He is one of the best performers in the competition in my opinion .

As a psychologist , staying together for the kids sake is NEVER in their best interest ... although as parents we seem to think so . Your children can sense that you are unhappy , even if you think you dont show it . Whats more is , if you have a son , he may get the impression that men dont touch their wives and grow up thinking thats how it is , and then in turn do that to his women . If you have a daughter , she may get the idea that she shouldnt need or want affection and marry someone as such and feel just as you are 20 years from now.I suggest talking to him . Telling him you do need affection . If he still wont budge , there is always counceling ... .but you must let him know you would leave him if thngs dont change . He may actually want out himself ."

a social unit living together,"Why do men say that women trap them with pregnancies ? I am just really curious as to why men always use the lame excuse and say that women trapped them with babies . It ' s really ridiculous , and I hear it all the time . It is so common on talk shows such as Maury , Jerry Springer , in life . I can also say that in the past I had an ignorant *** man say that I trapped him . How ridiculous ! I think he trapped me with all those lies ! That was many years ago , but I was just wondering . But really I think they do it as a way to dismiss thei responsiblity from parenthood , and to soothe their guilt . Men have been blaming women since back in the day in the Garden of Eden . How do you raise sons to be responsible and to respect women 's bodies ? I think they use that excuse to look like they are a victim , but who are they fooling ? It 's the responsibility of the male and female to protect themselves if they do n't desire children . Why is it that when we give them the news of the new baby they all of a sudden ask , are you sure its mine ? and my all time favorite : Why didnt you protect yourself ? I mean they think that we are the ones that have to use protection , why not them ? And then they think that we want to tie them down by having their kid .

a social unit living together,"How do I approach my wife about either adding another woman or going to see another woman by myself ? I just need some helpful suggestions here , please no moralistic preaching . Oh yes my friend you are so lucky I have bumped into your question . I have dedicated countless scientific hours to the study of this and I am happy to inform you that I have succeeded.THere are several aproaches you can take but first you need to find out why you want to do this ? a ) is it just a sexual thing ? b ) is it that you want to incorporate a second wife into the family dinamycs ? What exactly are you feeling ? Know that this is not a quick process , it will take you months if not years to work on her in order to agree to this and even then it may not happen ever.With that said lets get to it.If its the sexual thing then it will be a lot easier than you think , its not that hard to get a woman to agree to it , now the realtionship part that one will be a tought one but let me assure you that it can be done , I have done it and it works out great for all of us . I will tell you buddy that its not an easy life but the rewards are worth it to me.1- you need to prepare the grownd . Be very affectionate , be helpfull , you need to give in order to receive , you will have to become a pleaser . ie . breakfast in bed , do dishes , make sure she enjoys sex very much , compliments , flowers , etc.2-Avoid fights . dont get into it with her , make problems look like a thing of the past . If there is a disagreement or situation you talk about it in a civil manner , no name calling , no yelling . Be very understanding of the situation and her feelings , make consecions and move on , dont bring up the past no matter what , if you fail to do this you will be taking a few steps back.3-connect with her . make sure you reach a transendent connection with her , be more aware of her feelings and thoughts on many topics . Make sure you make time and place to talk to her , to discuss different things other than her job or friends , focus on HER and only HER.4-If you have children be more affectionate with the children and more involved with them , dont ' dump them on her or expect her to take care of them , cook breakfast for them on a sat morning and take them to the park so she can sleep in and have some alone time.This process could take anything between a month and a year tops but you will see some dramatic changes.At some point she will start doing more stuff for you , asking you how you are , cooking you up stuff you like , etc . THis is her way of reciprocating . If she does n't there will be a point in which you feel like you need to say something because you will feel neglected , ok when this happens RESIST , deal with it and continue doing your part . THen the second time you feel like you are going to explode say something , but remember NO YELLING AND NO FIGHTING ( that is the golden rule here ) , she will ask you what she could do and just say that you want her to show you as well that she cares and loves you , do n't say anything about a 3some , dont even hint it . Then give her a cpl days , she will spend this time thinking what she can do to make it up to you , at this point you have a conversation about things you would like her to do but still do n't bring up the other woman thing , wait . She will try to do this things , more than likely she will screw it up so you will have another conversation about it , again remember to be very civil about this , dont fight no matter what.Now you are ready to make a move ; if its for a simple sexual expirerience ask her during or right after sex : how she would feel about having sex with another woman ? and just listen , she will at some point ask you why ? or what you think ? either way your response will be that she is so sexy and she would look so much sexier having sex with another woman , the kissing , the touching , etc . Reasure her that she is the only woman in your life and you love her so much . THen all of the sudden kiss her and get down dirty to having sex again , but this time it has to be passionate , animal , porno kind of sex . She will make a coment about it and tell her that just picturing it in your"

a social unit living together,"i cont continue my sex more than 1 or 2 Min 's ... how can i full fill my wife ... . ? Best Answer - Chosen by AskerTry what they call Kegel exercises . They are easy to do and you can do them anywhere without anyone knowing.1 ) Try to contract the muscles you would use to stop urinating . You should feel your pelvic muscles squeezing your urethra and anus . If your stomach or buttocks muscles tighten , you are not exercising the right muscles.2 ) Once you 've found the right way to contract the pelvic muscles , squeeze for 3 seconds and then relax for 3 seconds.3 ) Repeat this exercise 10 to 15 times per session . Try to do this at least 3 times a day . Kegel exercises are only effective when done regularly . Do these for awhile and you will see a big change in your performance and your own orgasms .

I know this hurts but sounds like either she 's playing games with you or she 's bringing this up to make you jealous but either way it 's playing games . You need to tell her that you do n't have time for games either she wants to be with you or she wants to move on because she do n't need to be throwing up a crush and y'all just got back together . You need to tell her that life is all kinds of choices and she need to make the choice between you or her crush . Good Luck !

Do n't worry about your voice it will get deeper later on . I think the best thing you can do to court a girl is to give her flowers . A single red ( or if you know her favorite color then use that ) rose makes quite a statement . Have you told her you like her ? Do n't stress about it just be yourself and take it slow . Ask her out and when you pick her up have some flowers ready . If she likes stuffed animals you can give her little stuffed animals after you 've had a couple of dates . It 's really not hard . Do n't buy her really expensive things untill you get very serious . Be polite and respectful and complement her on the things she wears and even her perfume if she wears any . After you get serious you can send flowers to her work or her school . Girls like public displays of affection .

a social unit living together,"how do i no if a guy likes me ? Probably the best way to know if a guy likes you is to simply ask him , but we all know that can be a challenge . So , here are a few clues to working out if he likes you as much as you like him . Steps Examine his body language . If he likes you , you will see that his body position will lean forward toward you . Keep close . Ever get the feeling that somebody is `` in '' your personal space - so much so that you want to step back ? If he likes you and you like him , neither of you will step back . Make eye contact - if he likes you , he 'll get it and hold it . Again , this can be uncomfortable if you do n't like him or vice versa . You 'll know if you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else , or if he looks away quickly . Be aware of touching - he might put his hand on your arm when he laughs , or not move his leg if it happens to touch yours . This is a very good sign that he likes you . Keep an eye out . His pupils will dilate ( get bigger ) if he likes you - but this is quite hard to pick up on and you might look a bit weird looking that closely into his eyes . See if he keeps going out of his way to 'bump ' into you . Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do . Joke freely . Does he laugh even if you are n't funny ? Check for signs of nervousness : nervous laughter , sweaty palms , fidgeting ... Smile . A big smile in return probably means the feeling is mutual . See if he always end up in the same line or group as you . Tips Does he make an extra effort to be around you in certain situations ( dances , school , etc ) ? That could be a sign . His friends might often ask you how you feel about him . Chances are , if your stomach does a flip flop when you see him , his may be doing the same . Smile , be yourself , and let biology and fate work their charms . You can always ask a friend to ask him - but that can backfire . You ca n't really MAKE someone like you - but the best way to be noticed is to be true to yourself , feel good about yourself and never do anything you do n't want to do to get someone 's affection . Think about how you act when you like someone and look for those signs in others . Warnings Do n't spend too long trying to find out or you may look like a stalker and this will also backfire ."

The only things I could suggest would be to ask her to try to help him learn english as well , since it 's essential for his future schooling . Obviously you 've tried this approach , but it does n't hurt to continue . Secondly , whenever you do have him , spend alot of time talking to him . Try starting with just pointing things out and naming them constantly . At his age learning in two languages wo n't be that difficult , but since you do n't have him anywhere near as much as she does you need to be extra vigilant . Point out everything you see , objects , store names , actions , etc . You may think you sound stupid , but it 'll get through to him . And also I 'd suggest getting him some age-appropriate videos ( and VCR or DVD player if she does n't have one ) that he can watch at home . Watching pre-school/toddler programs in english will definitely help . My son has picked up so much watching these things and we speak english anyway ! Good luck , and just count your blessings that you have your son , and that with your help he will grow up bilingual !"

Health,"Does anyone know how to treat psoriasis ? I am suffering from psoriasis on the scalp and a little on hands , and feet . Also , two of my nails have become disfigured and pitted due to psoriasis . Psoriasis is a common skin disease , affecting approximately 2 percent to 4 percent of the U.S. population . Skin cells grow too quickly , causing lesions of red , raised patches that are covered with silvery scales . Complete recovery is rare . Steps : 1 . Reduce stress . Psoriasis is significantly aggravated by stress . 2 . Apply topical ointments , twice each day , to slow down the overactive growth of skin cells . Ointments that contain tar preparations , anthralin and salicylic acid work well . Try corticosteroid creams . These are most effective when covered with a piece of saran wrap . It enhances the drug 's penetration into the skin . Use it twice a day , wipe it off at bedtime , and then apply the tar preparation or anthralin at night . 3 . Avoid injuring the skin . This aggravates psoriasis . 4 . Avoid exposure to cold . This also aggravates psoriasis . 5 . Keep your skin from drying out . Dry skin causes psoriasis to worsen . 6 . Avoid washing your skin excessively . This makes skin feel sore and scaly . Use lukewarm water when washing . 7 . Reduce itching by soaking for 15 minutes in water containing a tar solution or Epsom salts . 8 . Remove thick scalp plaques by applying a 10 percent salicylic acid in mineral oil with a toothbrush before going to bed . Wear a shower cap when you sleep . Wash out the 10 percent acid with a tar-based shampoo the next morning . 9 . Consider a more aggressive treatment if your condition is severe . Exposure to ultraviolet light or a course of drug therapy are options . Exposure to the sun must be absolutely avoided when you are receiving treatment with ultraviolet light Tips : Mineral oil and baking soda paste Mix a small amount of baking soda and mineral oil into a paste ; about a 3:1 ratio . Apply the paste to the area and cover with Cling Wrap or waterproof tape if the area is small . Leave on overnight . Remove wrap and wash paste residue off in the morning , then apply some cocoa butter or perfume free moisturizer ."

Health,"How can families be offered counseling if a third-party ( i.e . insurance ) wo n't pay ? If the family of an addict needs to be present for that addict to get treatment , but a third-party wo n't pay for that treatment , how would the couselor be able to get the family involved ? First of all , when a counselor or treatment center is treating an addict and they involve the family in the treatment , I 've never heard of them billing the family . It is considered part of the treatment of the addict.However , if there is a particular counselor who wants to be paid separately from what he or she is being paid from the insurance company for treating the addicted person , they should be willing to make payment arrangements with the family members ( and make sure they are n't charging you too much - I would have to know what college degree the counselor has to give you some idea - but the MOST a PhD counselor gets from an insurance company is usually around $ 100 for a 50-minute session - no matter who is there ) .I hope this helped a little . Whenever you are `` paying privately '' ( i.e . not through insurance ) , doctors , dentists , counselors , etc . offer what they call a `` sliding fee scale , '' if you can not afford their rates . This is usually based on how much you can afford to pay and you reach a written agreement before services are provided . Take care ..."

Health,"Women , help me please ! ? This might be the toughest decision i have to make . I was date raped 12 weeks ago , and got pregnant by the mother****** . He left the country right after , so i decided to have an abortion . I live in a very conservative area , and decided to go for the Cytotec abortion . Took 12 pills and inserted 6 , bleeded 15 days , and come to find out today that the fetus is still alive . It already has a heartbeat , and i do n't want to abort it now because of that , but i live in fear that it will have birth defects related to the pills i took . Please help me clear my mind , i wo n't read any idiotic insults , as i realize what i did , nor will i pay attention to condemnig me , but what can i do now ? I was raped by my x . He got 8 months in jail while i recieved the rest of my life with the most beautiful girl . I tried abortion and was unable to finish it . Take this as a sign from God that there is a reason for this child . If you are unable to keep it than yes adopt the child out . The child you carry could very well save the world from cancer , come up with the next treatment for sever retardation in children , or invent the most increadible machine ever . What we choose to do makes a differance in the future . This has happened for a reason . Go see a doctor , take prenatal vitamans take care of yourself and this baby . The child living through the abortion pills and inseres makes me believe that this child is wanting to live . That should have been enough signs but if you are anything like myself I was takingin home preg tests up till 2 weeks before my daughter was born . I though it would go away . I laugh at this now 12 years later . I know you are scared and worrid about what this child may turn out like , but believe me if i have learned nothing in the last 13 years it is that God has a plan . I may not know what it is but I do know that when I look at the child i carried i still thank God she lived thought the last 13 years of her life . I spent the first 9 months trying to figure out how to get rid of this child , and since have spent the last 12 years 3 months trying to figure out how to save her from the tormoils of the world . Teenage years here we come . Take this as a blessing and move on . See a doctor , take care and always believe that the Lord will bring you through what ever you need.I often screamed at God telling him that he has forgoten me , does not realize that i am unable to deal with that which he has given me . Then i look at my childs eyes and realize . NOt only did he give me a way to work through the rape , he gave me the most amazing gift any one can have . A child who loves me for me .

Health,"What is better a fluoride toothpaste or a bicarbonate of soda toothpaste ? I would say fluoride toothpaste is much more effective in the long run than bicarbonate . Fluoride has the ability to be incorporated into your enamel to make it even harder and less prone to caries . It also has the ability to help remineralize incipient caries . Another factor that makes fluoride a good choice is its antiseptic properties vs. bacteria . Fluoride will diffuse into bacterial cells and inhibit enolase , a protein used by bacteria to breakdown glucose into energy . Without a way to metabolize fuel , the bacteria will die.Fluorinated water is usually in concentrations of about 1 part per million ( ppm ) , which is great for children who still have developing teeth . Children can drink this low level of fluoride and some will be used to help form teeth . Studies have shown however that systemic fluoride does very little to prevent tooth decay in adults because our teeth have stopped developing . Topical fluoride treatment is much more effective for adult teeth and a typical fluoride toothpaste has about 1000 ppm.Bicarbonate toothpastes are great for neutralizing the decay-causing acid secreted by the bacteria in your mouth . The problem is they only work while the toothpaste is in your mouth . There are no lasting effects and as soon you eat again , just as much acid will form . Unless you are willing to brush immediately after every time you eat , it wo n't likely serve as a great a benefit as fluoride ."
Health,"wieght loss ? well in the past 6 months or so ive gained 80 pounds and have been trying to loose it . ive tried crash dieting a few times but have never had the will power to go threw with it . what i need is how to get the will power Crash dieting will make you fatter in the long run . This is because your body goes into starvation mode . The human body is designed to hang onto fat in case of famine . This is something that we have carried with us since before we were living in caves and evolved because food sources were less certain at that time . We live in a modern world now where there is plenty of food . But our evolution is still in the caves and our bodies do not recognise this ( unfortunately ) . Hence the minute we cut calories drastically to try to lose weight quickly , our bodies behave as though each meal will be our last . The end result is our metabolisms slow right down . That is why we often end up fatter after a period of crash dieting . What you need to do is try to shift your mindset and make a lifestyle change that you will stick to . This calls for a new way of looking at food and eating for the rest of your life . The problem with diets is most people see them as short term fixes . Once they have achieved what they want to achieve ( i.e . weight loss ) , lots of people just go back to their former eating habits - then they are surprised that the weight comes back again - in spades ! Nutritionists everywhere agree that a healthy , balanced diet is the key to good health . Focus your diet on variety - primarily brightly coloured vegetables and fruit ( no more than 2 pieces of fruit a day - 3 in a pinch ) with more focus on vegetables . Give up mayo and fatty dressings . Cut fat off meat - visible fat - and remove the skin from chicken . Cook with any method that does not involve adding fat . Do not eat anything in breadcrumbs or pastry . Reduce bread but if you ca n't , eat wholegrain bread . Reduce fats generally . Minimise fast food . Drink water instead of fruit juices and diet soda ( I posted something here about diet soda earlier - it is not our friend ! ) . Cut out ALL processed foods - white anything , sugar , candy and cakes . Instead , snack on nuts ( or raw vegetables not dried fruit ) . Most of all , accept that you did not get fat overnight and you will not get slim overnight either . Tell yourself that this is a long term solution and you are willing to do the whole haul for the sake of your health.If you decide not to follow these principles and instead try to crash diet again , chances are in 6 months - a year 's time , you will be looking back still fat ( if not fatter ) and asking the same question about weight loss ."

Health,"wart problem ? ok , i have tried everything : getting them frozen off , wart remover , everything , and the warts keep coming back , and multiplying ... .very upset over this ... and becoming insecure ... .please help ! ! ! ! what should i do ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Hi Red RockHere are some ideas on how to heal the issue.CausesWarts are caused by any of 35 viruses and are often a consequence of poor diet and nutrition , poor hygiene , and , in the cases of genital warts , unprotected sex . Warts also become more common as a consequence of aging with corresponding diminished immune function.Caution : Some warts can turn into cancerous tumors . If they do not seem benign , consult with a physician immediately. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- ... Natural CuresNote : Natural healing of warts may require one to two months of care , with the wart disappearing suddenly in one to three days.Aromatherapy : Lemon essential oil applied topically can speed healing . Thuja oil is also effective for dealing with warts.Diet : Eat an organic , whole foods diet , emphasizing foods that are high in vitamin A , such as dark green and yellow vegetables , cold-water fish , eggs , and sulfur , such as onions , garlic , Brussels sprouts , cabbage , and broccoli . Avoid all refined and processed foods , sugar , unhealthy fats , and excess animal proteins , as well as milk and dairy products.Herbs : a.Onions for Warts : Warts have been said to disappear when treated perseveringly with raw onion dipped in salt . b.Wild Lettuce for Warts : The expressed juice is `` much regarded as an application to boils , abscesses and carbuncles , and if put upon warts will cause them to drop off . c.Garlic for Warts and Moles : Here is a very successful routine for removal of these unwanted growths called moles , or warts . Take a button of garlic , slice or cut in two , and placed the cup area over a wart of mole . Tape it on , and as it dries out put a fresh piece . Many users have reported good results . d.Cashew Oil : The cashew oil , which must be used with great caution , is used as an application to warts , corns , ringworms , cancerous ulcers . d.Potassium Deficiency for Warts and Moles : When cysts or tumors grow in places where they can be seen outside the body , often we react by having them cut out . This defeats healing by working on the effect instead of the cause . You can cut cysts out , tumors off , and burn warts off ( which are also a potassium deficiency ) , or get rid of as many moles as you wish , but unless you go to the cause , they will grow back again , and you may end up with as many or more cysts , tumors , moles as before . Different signs of potassium deficiency will keep popping out on the body because the condition that needs correcting is on the inside . You have to go into the cause , Dr. Christopher always insisted , which is the way we have been eating.Potassium sources : There are several ways to receive your potassium . Dr. Bernard Jensen sells a potassium broth made from dehydrated vegetables . Dr. Bronner makes a similar , excellent product . You can also make your own potassium broth by simmering equal parts of red potatoes , celery , carrots , onions , and herbs to taste . Raw vegetable and fruit juices also flood the system with potassium . Best of health to you"

Dear Bobo : I think it is very natural to feel worried about a heart attack if one 's father has just died of one a couple of months ago . Here is my answer : FIRST : You ARE worried ; the question is , SHOULD you be worried ? The answer is more difficult than just statistics . If you want statistics , cardiac risk , i.e . the risk of a heart attack can be easily calculated : http : //hp2010.nhlbihin.net/atpiii/calculator.aspBut as it states , this calculator , which is used nearly universally by physicians , applies only for those age 20 or greater . Why is that ? Because the heart is like pump -- like any mechanical thing , be it one 's car or one 's sneakers , it wears out over time , and the older one is , the more likely one is have one 's heart give out . Since 20 year olds rarely die of heart attacks ( i.e . unless you do crack , etc ) , its not possible to calculate the odds for the `` average '' 16 year old.SECOND : What IS a heart attack ? Generally , it implies a blockage of one of the arteries supplying blood to the heart . The heart , like any muscle , or any machine , requires fuel -- in this case , oxygen , which is supplied to it by the piping called coronary arteries . When these get plugged up , like any pipe , what is needed ca n't get through . When this happens to living tissue , the tissue dies . In the case of the heart , as it is the main ( and only ) pump supplying blood to the rest of the body , if the damage is servere enough , then the pump ( i.e . heart ) completely fails , the entire body is starved of oxygen , and one passes away.What , then , makes one more likely to have a heart attack ? Many things , such as genetics , i.e . a family history of heart disease . But , from this discription , anything that stresses or clogs the piping ( arteries ) to the heart -- i.e . causes heart disease , also known as atherosclerosis . Stuff like high blood pressure , smoking , diabetes ( sugar in the piping , like sugar-water on the table , is sticky and gums up the works ) , high cholesterol , obesity ( which is often a cause of SLEEP APNEA ) , all increase one 's risk.Generally , when a healthy 16 year old walks into a doctor 's office asking , am i at risk for a heart attack , the physician will likely wonder why the patient is asking , rather than being worried about the patient actually being at risk.Which brings me to YOUR question : `` could somebody help me ? '' -- the answer I think is : please , please consider talking to a counselor at your school ; friends , siblings , a hotline , a doctor . You are worried about your mortality ; And right after a family member has died , more so . It 's natural , but often , it helps to talk about it . Go ask your doctor this question , and see what she or he has to say . It 'll be worth it . As for heart disease , see your doctor regularly over the years , listen to their advice , and . . .Keep well , keep healthy. -- -- -- -Disclaimers : In addition to the disclaimers already stated by Yahoo.com : NOTE : The information communicated here does not constitute or imply a patient-doctor interaction or relationship ; the reader and/or recipient of any `` answer '' agrees to hold the writer harmless from any loss , harm , injury or damage resulting from or arising out of your submission of the question or your use of or reliance on any response thereto.As Stated : Yahoo !

Health,"Do I get rid of aphasia after I had a stroke un '97 ? Aphasia , a total or partial loss of the ability to use words , sometimes is quickly and completely cured after a stroke . Since your case has been for a number of years , it is likely that aggressive therapy is necessary . To date , treatment is mostly confined to speech therapy which helps to improve reading , writing , and comprehension skills . Speech pathologists and neurologists would be best trained to help you recover . You should certainly contact a neurologist for more treatment information . According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke , patients tend to recover skills in language comprehension more completely than those skills involving expression.On a more global level , there are a number of people who believe neural connections can be re-forged through increased usage . A number of studies have shown that those who think more or are involved in more intelletually challenging tasks are less at risk for Alzheimer 's disease , for example . This may very well be true for stroke patients . Keep working hard and seek as much help as you can . Best of luck ."

Health,"What does phototoxic mean ? referring to grapefruit essential oil : Safety Information : Phototoxic . Do not use if the area of application will be exposed to sunlight for 24 hours due to its phototoxicityObviously I can see that it will have a reaction with the sunlight , but what exactly will happen ? What kind of toxins are produced ? A phototoxic substance is a chemical compound which becomes toxic only when exposed to light.Phototoxicity is a phenomenon known in live-cell live cell fluorescence microscopy , where illuminating a fluorescent molecule ( the fluorescently active site is called a fluorophore ) causes the selective death of the cells expressing it . While not completely understood , it seems to be clear that the main cause for phototoxicity is the formation of oxygen radicals due to non-radiative energy transfer.Typically in fluorescence , photons of a certain wavelength excite electrons of the illuminated fluorophore to higher energy states . When these excited electrons return to a lower energy state , they emit a photon with a lower energy level thus causing the emission of light of a longer wavelength . This principle of fluorescence is also known as Stokes shift.Unfortunately for microscopists , in many cases some of the energy is not used for this radiative energy transfer but is transferred to oxygen causing the formation of oxygen radicals . These radicals are highly toxic to living cells , sometimes killing cells in seconds.Phototoxicity in live cells depends strongly on the kind of fluorescent molecule used . The isolation and characterization of fluorescent proteins such as green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) has provided biologists with fluorochromes which show a much weaker phototoxic effect compared to most smaller chemically synthesized fluorescent molecules such as FITC or rhodamine . Still , the energy level of excitation light as well as the duration of illumination must be minimized to ensure long-term survival of living cells during fluorescent imaging. # May cause a skin reaction such as burning , irritation , or pigment change upon exposure to ultra-violet light ( sunlight , tanning lights ) .www.simplers.com/herbal/definition.htm # sun exposure causes skin pigmentationwww.aworldofaromatherapy.com/aromatherapy-glossary.htm # increases the sensitivity of the skin to sunlight and ultraviolet radiation to the point of toxicitywww.lovingscents.com/Glossary.htm"

Health,"what are the side effects of pienis enlargment pills ? For your benefit , and information , I feel it wise to inform you that penis enlargement pills do not actually increase the literal size or length of your penis , but merely `` improve '' blood circulation and flow to the nether-region to give the erection a slightly larger , more `` engorged '' ( and therefore , larger ) in appearance . So really , they should be called something other than `` penis enlargement pills . '' Depending on which brand of so-called `` penis enlargement pills '' you intend to try , you may be ingesting organic ( natural ) extracts , herbal substances , vitamins , flavors , fillers , dyes , waxes , binders , etc . There has also been some evidence and documentation of these products being contaminated by a number of undesirable ingredients . ( For more information about this in general , see the Wiki article I 've linked you to in my sources . ) As far as side-effects are concerned , depending on which ingredients are used in the `` penis enlargement '' pill you 've chosen , you may experience many of the side-effects involved in taking stimulants and other medications which oxygenate the blood and improve circulation . Specifically , some of those side effects may include : upset stomach , nausea , anxiety , hallucinations , insomnia , headaches , loss of muscle function , increased blood pressure as well as rapid heartbeat , dizziness , and severe hypertension to name a few ... ***It should be noted that these side-effects are presumably possible in a normal , otherwise healthy subject . These pills may actually exacerbate any negative symptoms or complaints accompanying previously existing medical conditions such as high blood pressure ... Personally , I believe `` penis enlargement '' pills are not a necessity for sexual performance or vitality . Perhaps they have a `` placebo-like '' value to them , which helps improve the consumer 's self-esteem , ego , and self-image which is definitely beneficial as far as boosting the individual 's confidence in intimate situations , but they should n't ever be a requirement . In my opinion , if you want to be in the ranks of male `` sexual dynamos '' and `` great lovers , '' you should be more concerned about learning how to properly `` USE '' the equipment you were born with for the maximum benefit and pleasure of yourself , as well as those with whom you have sexual interactions , and less concerned about the physical `` size '' of your equipment . It has been my experience that guys who are obsessed with increasing the size of their package think that increased size will compensate for poor technique and what I like to call , `` operator error . '' = ) Penile penetration is n't everything , however . Learning to administer pleasure in other ways , ( i.e. , massage , or perhaps incorporating sexual aids and toys ) may be a positive and healthy alternative to imaginary `` penis enlargement . '' You may discover that seeking alternative methods and means of giving and receiving pleasure is very sexually stimulating as well as sexually satisfying . So basically , in this girl 's opinion , SIZE REALLY DOES N'T MATTER , as long as you know how to `` work it '' with what you 've got ! Cheers !"

Health,"child birth ? what is it like ? how do u start preparing ? what exactly happens ? the person with the best detail but informative is gauranteed 5 stars ! : ) The birth starts with the onset of labour , which is usually marked by the beginning of regular uterine contractions . These are felt as tightenings either in the back or across the top of the womb . Sometimes the baby 's waters break before the beginning of the contractions or , more commonly , once labour is under way . A mucous show is often passed through the vagina at the beginning of labour , which may have streaks of blood in it . Some women pass the show days before going into labour , other women do not pass a show at all , so it is not a reliable sign of labour . During a natural birth , the muscles in the uterus ( womb ) contract and it 's this contraction that 's felt as labour pains . Labour is a painful experience , but breathing techniques learned in antenatal classes can make early labour less stressful . The contractions cause the baby 's head to be pressed down through the pelvis and against the inside of the cervix . This causes the cervix to stretch open ( dilate ) allowing the baby 's head to pass through ( descend ) into the vagina and onwards into the outside world . The birth begins when labour contractions start becoming frequent , intense and of sufficient duration to cause the cervix to open . At the beginning of labour , you will usually be examined externally ( abdominal examination ) , to see how the baby is lying and to be certain that the baby is coming head first . When labour starts , the cervix gets shorter ( a process called effacement ) and opens ( dilates ) . The cervix is fully dilated when it has opened 10cm . During labour , it 's important you do n't start pushing before you are fully dilated , because there will be a danger of tearing the cervix . Once your cervix has fully dilated , the first stage of labour is completed and the second stage is about to begin . The first stage generally lasts up to 12 hours in a first labour and seven hours in subsequent deliveries , but each labour is different . The second stage starts when your cervix is completely open ( 10cm ) . Usually , there is a sensation of fullness in your vagina or bowel and you wish to push . Most women will find that the labour pains in the second stage of labour are more bearable , because you can now actively help yourself by pushing . The second stage of labour ends with the delivery of the baby . It usually lasts for 45 minutes to two hours in a first labour and 15 to 45 minutes in subsequent deliveries . During this stage the afterbirth ( placenta ) is delivered . The placenta is usually delivered within 5 to 15 minutes after the birth of the baby . The last stage of birth is a co-operation between yourself and the midwife , although little effort is required to deliver the placenta.After your baby 's born , it 's routine that you will be given an injection to stimulate the uterus to contract , which helps delivery of the placenta . Making the uterus contract in this way reduces the risk of heavy bleeding during delivery of the placenta ( post-partum haemorrhage ) ."

Possiblities include bladder infection , kidney infection , ovreactive bladder , diabetes and a bunch of other stuff.Things you can do to cope are limit your fluid intake ( which you are already doing ) and maybe even look into adult diapers ( I know it 's embarassing but it 's better to have protection then get caught standing in a puddle in the middle of the super market ) . I think they make large super absorbant pads that are a little like wearing a menstral pad but thicker . Those might be less embarassing than adult diapers.Good luck , I know it 's frustrating to wait to get into the specialist ."
Health,"is it true that we swallow spiders in our sleep ? Believe it or not , it is very true . On average , people ingest between 2-3 spiders per year while they are sleeping . Spiders ( and other insects ) like dark , damp places to hide , and your mouth is sometimes seen as a 'perfect ' place to hide . Gross , is n't it ? Do n't stress to much about it though , chances are you have already eaten a couple of dozen spiders and you never even knew about it . Just think of it as protein ! Sweet dreams ..."

Health,"what is the best diet pill ? Diet pills do work , although not forever . You see , diet pills are like any other drug your body builds resistance to them and their effectiveness wears off when you take them for a while . They do work short term but there are better ways to boost your metabolism and lose the weight.There are several ways to boost your metabolism but lets look at the factors that drive your metabolism first . 1 . Genetics - you have very little control , but you are not a prisoner of your genes . 2 . Lean Muscle Mass - this one throws most people off because women think , oh no I dont want muscles and men think I guess I have to look like a body builder . Lean muscle mass is simply your weight minus the weight of your organs , bones , fluids and fat . You increase lean muscle mass primarily through eating properly , resistance exercise , and a lifestyle that doesnt promote catabolizing activites ( smoking , heavy drinking and drug use ) 3 . Frequency of meals - the more meals the more the metabolic processes take place in your body and the faster your metabolism.4 . Water Intake - dehydration is a major drag on metabolism.Most people are dehydrated and they dont know it.5 . Sleep - getting enough rest allows the body to function at a higher metabolic level.You will learn more than you ever knew about metabolism from my source . I cant type it all here , just click the link.http : //www.jtfit.com/metabolism/"

Health,"Does anyone know of any other test besides blood test to test for thyroid problems ? My husband had 2 docs tell him that he had all the symtoms of thryoid disease before they ran the blood test and when both test came back they were normal . He has heard that there is another test that can be done with a dye as an outpatient , does anyone know what they are talking about ? And is there any other problem that mimics thyroid disease ? In the `` Alternative Health '' circles , most will agree that the standard TSH ( thyroid stimulating hormone ) test does n't cut the mustard ! Its the one that most docs do . It can come back as a normal reading , but in fact the thyroid can be low . I have run into the same situation myself . Tests say normal , but I have all the symptoms of hypothyroid .

If you are passing more than say a big table spoon then you need to go and get checked out by your doctor . Weak bladder can cause this , but like I said , its not common . Hope this helps out , kind of hard to diagnose over the Internet cause lab tests and exams are a key part of it ."

I know this may sound stupid to most of you , but I do n't know : ( Well , I was with this guy from September 8th -12th and although we did not engage in sexual intercourse , I gave him a handjob and he fingered me . Although his fingers were n't like `` dripping '' with his semen or anything , I 'm worried MAYBE there might have been *some* of it on him . He also never went inside of me , he was just rubbing `` down there '' Well , I got my full period three days later ( on Sept. 15 ) and got my period again on ( although it was late like 2-3 days ) October 16th . Usually , I spot around ovulation , but this month I did n't . My breasts hurt a lot and stuff , and have been hurting since when I should have ovulated ( Oct. 31st ) I should have my period next week some time , if everything is `` normal '' The question is , is there any way that I could still be pregnant ? I am SO worried , I think maybe the guilt is getting to my head . I understand I am not ready for this stuff . Any help is appreciated . I 'd say yes , everything sounds normal . You sound a little young . When you 're younger , you 're period will be irregular , and could be on an off schedule until you 're around 20 or so , then it should be the same every month . I 'm still kinda young and sometimes I 'll go for 2 months w/out my period and beleive me it scares the crap outa me . My doctor said not to worry about it , and that sometimes your period will only last 2-3 days whereas other times it 'll be like 8-9 days ! Or atleast untill your period regulates . It 's a slim chance you 're pregnant , very very , so I would n't worry about that . As far as your breasts hurting , well mine get reallly tender right before my period , so that may be happening to you , which would be good meaning you 're not pregnant ! Just to be on the safe side , if I were you I 'd take a pregnancy test a week after you were supposed to get your period ( or a week after you do ) . Good luck and try not to be such a nervous wreck , enjoy yourself !"

Health,"why do we get mouth ulcer ? The exact cause of mouth ulcers is unknown , but in some cases they are thought to be caused by an overreaction by the body 's own immune system . Factors that appear to provoke them include stress , fatigue , illness , injury from accidental biting , hormonal changes , menstruation , sudden weight loss , food allergies and deficiencies in vitamin B12 , iron and folic acid . Some drugs , such as nicorandil , have been linked with mouth ulcers.Mouth ulcers are thought to form when the body becomes aware of and attacks chemicals which it does not recognize . The presence of the unrecognized molecules garners a reaction by the lymphocytes , which trigger a reaction that causes the damage of a mouth ulcer.Trauma to the mouth is a common cause of mouth ulcers . Physical trauma , such as toothbrush abrasion , poking with sharp food , accidental biting , or dental braces can cause mouth ulcers by breaking the mucous membrane . Other factors , such as chemical irritants or thermal injury , may also lead to the development of ulcers . However in many cases , the precise cause is unknown.A common cause of ulcers is gluten intolerance , in which case consumption of wheat , rye , or barley can result in chronic mouth ulcers . If gluten intolerance is the cause , prevention means taking most breads , pastas , cakes , pies , cookies , scones , biscuits , beers etc . out of the diet and substituting gluten-free varieties where available . Artificial sugars , such as those found in diet cola and sugarless gum , have been reported as causes of mouth ulcers as well . They can also be linked to an increased intake of acid such as the acidic form Vitamin C or citric acid . In this case the sores disappear after intake decreases or a non acidic form of the vitamin is taken.Other disorders can cause mouth ulcers , including oral thrush , leukoplakia , gingivostomatitis , and oral lichen planus . Mouth ulcers are also associated with ulcerative colitis , Crohn 's disease , coeliac disease ( gluten sensitivity ) , bullous pemphigoid , and Behçet 's disease . Repeat episodes of mouth ulcers can also be indicative of an immunodeficiency , signalling low levels of immunoglobulin in the mucous membrane of the mouth . Chemotherapy is a common cause of mouth ulcers . The treatment depends on the believed cause ."

Health,"My lower back really hurts . What can I do to make it stop ? I was lifting heavy boxes and now it hurts . I pulled my back years ago and have recurrent back aches , so I empathize with you . Its hard to stand when you 're sitting , hard to sit when you 're standing , hard to walk , hard to turn to look back , etc . etc . First of all , you should see a doctor to rule out a slipped disk , ligament tear , etc.. Second , and until you can get attention , the best help for back pain is to stay off the back , and that means lying down flat on your back on a firm mat/mattress ( not hard floor or soft couch or mattress ) . Do n't put a pillow under your head . Tent your legs at the knee and stay that way , for as long as you can . That is the best . You may want to take an analagesic or something , and if you have a heating pad , heat helps reduce the muscle spasm . I use a muscle relaxant tablets and an anti-inflamatory cream , heat and stay off my back at every opportunity till it eases . Do n't exercise and try pulling your knees up to your chest until the acute phase of the spasm has eased or you ease pulling the muscle and have years of pain . Also , if you have to sit , be sure it is a firm chair , do n't slouch and try to keep your back perpendicular to your lap . Hope the pain eases soon for you"

I mean , assault weapons ? These people think we should be able to own ASSAULT WEAPONS ? ! I just do n't get it . Can someone explain ? Gun control had never worked . Please provide a link so that your `` proof '' can be seen . Assault weapons have been illegal to own since 1968 ( unless you get a special class III license from the B.A.T.F . ) so I do n't understand your problem there . You need to read the book by John Lott . `` More Muns , Less Crime '' . Also , the FBI recently did a study that shows that from 1991 to 2005 , Americans have bought 70,000,000 guns , yet crime , since '91 has decreased by 38 % . I ca n't find this study on-line , I read about it in a magazine . Concealed carry works also . Florida 's 2005 murder rate was 58 % lower than in 1986 , which was the year before Florida adopted ( wisely ) Right to Carry laws . There are already many laws to keep the wrong people from buying firearms . The problem is that for some reason , criminals will not obey the law ! ! They keep acquiring guns illegally . So more laws are obviously not the answer . Laws only affect the law abiding . And by the way , I am NOT a conservative .

But when he was rejected by the Green Berets because he failed their grueling physical tests , he lost faith . This rejection devasted him . It created anger toward the American government and military . He channeled his anger into right wing extremist hate groups .

NEW YORK - The number of city residents relying on food from charities and unable to feed their families is rising , according to a report issued by an advocacy group . Nearly one in six city residents lived in households that could not afford to buy enough food during the three year period ending in 2005 , according to the New York City Coalition Against Hunger report released Tuesday.These households made up 15.4 percent of city residents — up from 14 percent between 2000 and 2003 , according to the report , which was based in part on figures from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.According to the coalition 's survey of the city 's food pantries and soup kitchens , the number of people served by those charities rose an estimated 11 percent in 2006 . `` I do think there 's an increased demand , especially when I know that many of my staff in my own agency utilize food kitchens in between pay periods , '' the city 's top welfare official , Human Resources Commissioner Verna Yes ... .Why am I responsible for your laziness , stupidity and poor judgment ? ? ? ?

The mother of my boyfriends child agreed to let him pick the child up from her state and bring him to Texas for good . There is no court order or written agreement and now she claims she wants the child back . He went and filed for a child support on her a few weeks ago because she was saying he 'd never see the child again once he came back .

Any legal aids advice please help . She has threatned to file but we believe we filed first . She had custody of the child initially because he did n't ask for it . If he had , then there would have been a custody agreement . It sounds like one is needed now . Probably she will have permanent custody & he will have visitation rights.I sure hope that they can come together & provide the child with a stable and loving home environment .

the study of government of states and other political units,"Is there anybody with a phyical or mental age over 14 who can give one valid reason why `` Bush lied '' ? Without using the same , tired rhetoric that we always hear from you people ... you know , that stuff you heard from Al Franken that you repeat here without realizing that it did n't actually make sense when he said it.HINT : If your posts are usually incomplete sentences filled with random , disjointed thoughts and crammed with spelling errors and annoying abbreviations , you are not the person to answer this question . No , Bush did not deceive the American people . Please consider the following information as reference : Iraqis can participate in three historic elections , pass the most liberal constitution in the Arab world , and form a unity government despite terrorist attacks and provocations . Yet for some critics of the president , these are minor matters . Like swallows to Capistrano , they keep returning to the same allegations -- the president misled thecountry in order to justify the Iraq war ; his administrationpressured intelligence agencies to bias their judgments ; Saddam Hussein turned out to be no threat since he did n't possess weapons of mass destruction ; and helping democracy take root in the Middle East was a postwar rationalization . The problem with these charges is that they are false and can be shown to be so -- and yet people continue to believe , and spread , them . Let me examine each in turn : The president misled Americans to convince them to go to war . `` There is no question [ the Bush administration ] misled the nation and led us into a quagmire in Iraq , '' according to Ted Kennedy . Jimmy Carter charged that on Iraq , `` President Bush has not been honest with theAmerican people . '' And Al Gore has said that an `` abuse of the truth '' characterized the administration 's `` march to war . '' These charges are themselves misleading , which explains why no independent body has found them credible . Most of the world was operating from essentiallythe same set of assumptions regarding Iraq 's WMD capabilities . Important assumptions turned out wrong ; but mistakenly relying on faulty intelligence is a world apart from lying about it.Let 's review what we know . The National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) is the intelligence community 's authoritative written judgment on specific national-security issues . The 2002 NIE provided a keyjudgment : `` Iraq has continued its [ WMD ] programs in defiance of U.N. resolutions and restrictions . Baghdad has chemical and biological weapons as well as missiles with ranges in excess of U.N. restrictions ; if left unchecked , it probably will have a nuclear weapon during this decade . `` Thanks to the bipartisan Silberman-Robb Commission , whichinvestigated the causes of intelligence failures in the run-up to the war , we now know that the President 's Daily Brief ( PDB ) and the Senior Executive Intelligence Brief `` were , if anything , more alarmist and less nuanced than the NIE '' ( my emphasis ) . We also know that the intelligence in the PDB was not `` markedly different '' from that given to Congress . This helps explains why John Kerry , in voting to givethe president the authority to use force , said , `` I believethat a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a threat , and a grave threat , to our security . '' It 's why Sen. Kennedy said , `` We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction . '' And it 's why Hillary Clinton said in 2002 , `` In the four years since the inspectors , intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuildhis chemical and biological weapons stock , his missile delivery capability and his nuclear program . `` Beyond that , intelligence agencies from around the globe believed Saddam had WMD . Even foreign governments that opposed his removal from power believed Iraq had WMD : Just a few weeks before Operation Iraqi Freedom , Wolfgang Ischinger , German ambassador to the U.S. , said , `` I think all of our governments believe that Iraq has producedweapons of mass destruction and that we have to assume that they continue to have weapons of mass destruction . `` In addition , no serious person would justify a war based oninformation he knows to be false and which would be shown to be false within months after the war concluded . It is not as if the WMD stockpile question was one that was n't g"

It is puzzling as to why Bush 's folks would so brazenly display the banner for all the world to see . Because certainly it 's obvious : no weapons of mass destruction have or will be found ( unless the U.S. plants them ) ; nor did the Iraqi government use any against the United States . So that mission was n't accomplished . And it 's pretty clear that the Iraqi civilians have n't been liberated , unless you consider being shot at and killed for protesting against the United States , liberation . Or having your collective history and rich culture destroyed in a matter of weeks , liberation . Or going without sufficient food , water or medical care , liberation . Or having an interim government imposed on you , liberation . So that mission , unfortunately , was n't accomplished either.Pretty pathetic scorecard . But certainly if Karl Rove decided to parade the banner `` Mission Accomplished , '' they had to have accomplished something . So as Mr. Bush dragged on with his insipid speech , one would continue ponder what exactly was the mission ?

I think you ask a really good question . I ca n't make a blanket statement by saying that all forms of violence are terrorism . I think any kind of violence that is not for the greater cause of justice for humanity and overall human rights ( not just one specific cultures ' ethnocentric aim at human rights ) could be considered terrorism . I would assert that the allies struggle against facism in World War II was not terrorism , but a fight AGAINST terrorism - but there are very few wars like that in our world 's history . This war in Iraq IS NOT WWII . I think I probably would assert that the US is asserting a form of terrorism because while we may be figting for the people of Iraq , we ARE MOST DEFINITELY also fighting for our own interests . that is exactly what the Muslims are doing . Innoncent people have been killed and I 'm quite sure there was terror when we bombed Baghdad . Terrorism is most definitely not a Muslim ideal . the only true way to not be a terrorist , however , is to utlimately seek the SELFLESS cause of peace for humanity - not just for yourself or your own culture - and we must divorce the idea of violence being the only away to achieve justice from our thinking .

Mrs Kennedy is sitting there ... riding along ... her husband gets shot and senator in front of her gets shot ... then they all hear 2 more shots bounce off the pavement and all this time she sits in the car ... cause she knows the shots are coming from outside the car . then the fatal shot , and she clearly sees the gun in the drivers hand ... at this moment she realizes what is going on and attempts to leap from the car ... only to be stopped and pushed back in by secret service.but then you have to wonder ... .why were n't the secret service men on the back of the limo like they were prior to the turn into the plaza ? all the videos show them on the back of the car . but what most do n't see or have never seen is the video of them being ordered off the car as it turns by a high ranking CIA officer from the car behind the president . you even see one CIA guy shrugging out of confusion ... he knows his job is to protect the president yet he was ordered to stop doing his job . plus they could n't be on the back of the car as that would stop the line of sight for shots from the driver , oswald , grassy knoll and beside the building.history today has proven that the government killed its own president . and people today ca n't believe that our government would kill a few thousand to create a cause that they feel is justified ? people that think its not possible do n't understand how the real world works , how the world banking community works , who owns what companies , etc . as it is all tied together and if the real truth did fully get out ... .there would be a massive uprise of the people to over throw all governments in the world.Even Ford ( creator of the model A & T ) himself stated back in 1919 `` If the World knew who actually controled the money in the World , the World would revolte and destroy all governments '' .Ford was actually trying to give the public a hint so they would look into more ... but they did n't understand the hint at that time.Hopefully the world is smarter to today to take the hints ."

Unfortunately , the responses from the general users of this forum resort to a stereotype of the Mexican population . We say Mexican , because we do n't hear any other race being discussed here . Do you honestly think they would stop labeling the Mexicans if their status is LEGAL ? We think it 's a great excuse to hide behind the `` we are not against Mexicans , we are against Illegal Mexicans . '' The focus is race , on prejudice , and aimed at how every American 's tax dollars go to subsidize the illegals .

the study of government of states and other political units,"What do you really think of George W. Bush , the president of the United States of America ? A fool , a hero ? Let me know your thoughts about him ! George W. Bush is a multifaceted man . He is definitely a social conservative -- and in that , he and I have absolutely nothing in common -- , but he is also not a raging nationalist ( and I celebrate the latter , especially with regards to immigration ) . He is pro big business , but he is not an economic conservative ( his administration 's spending is extraordinarily high ) . It also is the case that there have been spectacular changes between the two administrations he 's lead . The first four years were dominated by dismal decision-making , war-mongering , deception , terrible self-inflicted damage to the image of the US internationally , foolish foreign policy , etc . The second Bush administration has been orders of magnitude better on the foreign policy front , with Condoleeza Rice at the helm ( now the US is finally learning to talk to leftist governments in Latin America , for example , rather than to shun and isolate them , creating the sort of resentment that does n't help the US in the long run ) .I have cringed at the Supreme Court nominations of Mr. Bush , particularly that of Samuel Alito . And I am appalled by the reluctance of this administration to set free Gitmo prisoners who have already been tried and found innocent of any wrong-doing . I think there 's much more we will learn ( hopefully ) about domestic spying , and when all is said and done , History will remember Mr. Bush rather unkindly as a President , given his penchant for secrecy , for engaging in serious violations of the law of the land , and for hypocritical political maneuvers like unclassifying classified documents by issuing orders to *leak* the information to the press.But Bush the man seems rather affable , and I can not bring myself to blame him for everything that has gone wrong with his administration . He gives me the impression of being somewhat incompetent for the position he holds , of being stubborn to the point of stupidity -- like Stephen Colbert said yesterday nigh , the Presiden is a man who believes on Wednesday what he believed on Monday , despite what happened on Tuesday -- , and of having selective episodes of compassion -- as in the case of illegal immigrants -- and responsibility -- as was the case when Mr. Bush , to my astonishment and profound delight -- came out in support of the Muslim American community , calling on citizens not to make our plight into a religious conflict ."

So your a Socialist.The National Socialist German Workers Party ( German : Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei ( help·info ) ) , better known as the NSDAP or the Nazi Party was a political party that was led to power in Germany by Adolf Hitler in 1933 . The term Nazi is a short form of the German word Nationalsozialist shortened to two syllables , and spelled with -zi , because the ti syllable is pronounced [ tsi ] in German . After Hitler 's appointment as Chancellor and the democratic election of the party to lead the German government in 1933 , the NSDAP organized and established the Third Reich.Socialism is a social and economic system ( or the political philosophy advocating such a system ) in which the economic means of production are owned and controlled collectively by the people . This control may be either direct , exercised through popular collectives such as workers ' councils , or it may be indirect , exercised through a State .

the study of government of states and other political units,"Looking for info on the Sullivan rule as per `` only child '' , in combat. ? Contrary to popular belief , `` only sons , '' `` the last son to carry the family name , '' and `` sole surviving sons '' must register for the draft , they can be drafted , and they can serve in combat . However , they may be entitled to a peacetime deferment if there is a military death in the immediate family . Provisions regarding the survivors of veterans were written into Selective Service law after World War II . Details have varied over the years , but the basic premise remains the same ; where a family member has been lost as a result of military service , the remaining family members should be protected insofar as possible.It is important to keep in mind that the provisions are directly related to service-connected deaths . The mere fact that a man is the only child or only son does not qualify him for consideration - he must be the survivor of one who died as a result of military service.The present law provides a peacetime exemption for anyone whose parent or sibling was killed in action , died in line of duty , or died later as a result of disease or injury incurred in line of duty while serving in the armed forces of the United States . Also included are those whose parent or sibling is in a captured or missing status as a result of service in the armed forces during any period of time . This is known as the `` surviving son or brother '' provision . A man does not have to be the only surviving son in order to qualify ; if there are four sons in a family and one dies in the line of duty , the remaining three would qualify for surviving son or brother status under the present law.The surviving son or brother provision is applicable only in peacetime . It does not apply in time of war or national emergency declared by the Congress.The original law , passed in 1948 , exempted the sole surviving son of a family where one or more sons or daughters died as a result of military service . No restriction existed at that time to limit the exemption to peacetime . The provision was intended to protect families which had lost a member in World War II.In 1964 , recognizing that sons of World War II veterans were reaching draft age , Congress changed the law to include the sole surviving son of a family where the father , or one or more sons or daughters , died as a result of military service . At this time the peacetime-only restriction was also added to the law.A further change was made in 1971 , expanding the exemption to any son , not necessarily the sole surviving son , of a family where the father , brother or sister died as a result of military service . This provision was recently expanded to include mothers.Military DischargesIn addition to peace-time draft deferrment , the Department of Defense authorizes discharges for any son or daughter in a family in which the father or mother or one or more sons or daughters : Have been killed in action or have died when serving in the U.S. Armed Forces from wounds , accident , or disease.Are in a captured or missing-in-action status.Have a permanent 100 percent Service-related disability ( including 100 percent mental disability ) , as determined by the Veterans ' Administration or one of the Military Services , and are not gainfully employed because of the disability.Under the provisions of DOD Directive 1315.15 , this is a voluntary separation procedure which must be initiated by the service member . It does not apply during times of War or National Emergency declared by Congress.It also does not apply to commissioned officers or warrant officers unless they were involuntarily drafted into the Armed Forces ( as there is currently no draft going on , that means commissioned officers and warrant officers can not be released from service under this provision ) .Additionally , service members who enlist , reenlist , or voluntarily extends his or her active duty period after having been notified of the family casualty on which the surviving status is"

Technically the people do not select the president , that is done through the electoral college , which was created because the formers of the Constitution believed that the people of the United States were too stupid to elect the president themselves .

I was born in march of '76 so Johnson , Carter , Reagan , Bush Sr. , Clinton , and dubya I have seen twelve people serve in this capacity , eleven of whom were elected , one appointed . That was Gerald Ford . Six of these individuals were democrats , and six were republican . Seven were president during a wartime situation , five were not . Four of our wartime presidents were democrats and three were republicans . A few skirmishes that ocurred , such as 'the bay of pigs ' , the 'Ghana rescue mission ' , are not identified here as wartime situations . It is difficult to rate these men in order of effectiveness except to say that Franklin Delano Roosevelt stands out as an accomplish leader . He brought this nation out of a depression , he was in office when social security began , and he guided this nation through WWII . He showed courage and leadership when others cowered , and he did all this from a wheelchair ."

the study of government of states and other political units,"Which country helped the USA to acheive independance from Britian ? France and Spain.See the article below : Agents of the new nation ( USA ) —notably Benjamin Franklin , Arthur Lee , Silas Deane , and later John Adams—were striving to get help , and in 1777 Pierre de Beaumarchais had succeeded in getting arms and supplies sent to the colonials in time to help win the battle of Saratoga . That victory made it easier for France to enter upon an alliance with the United States , for which Franklin and the comte de Vergennes ( the French foreign minister ) signed ( 1778 ) a treaty . Spain entered the war against Great Britain in 1779 , but Spanish help did little for the United States , while French soldiers and sailors and especially French supplies and money were of crucial importance .

the study of government of states and other political units,"For those who want Bush impeached and removed from office , how do you propose it be done ? Impeachment is the process of bringing a federal officer ( President , Vice President , federal judge , etc . ) up on charges . It is not a conviction , or a removal from office . Only the U.S. House of Representatives has the power to impeach , and it only takes a simple majority . The U.S. Senate is where the trial is held , and it takes a 2/3 majority to convict and remove from office.Since the Dems have enough votes in the House ( once they take office in January ) to impeach , but nowhere near enough votes in the Senate , how do you propose they go about removing Bush ( and Cheney ) from office ? Or , in other words , how would you convince 16 Repubs to vote against their party and commit political suicide ( It takes 67 votes , and the Dems only have 51 ) ? ever notice that the idiot liberals never seem to elaborate that . the sad part about that is when you compare slick willie and the cigars to the president who at least did something to al qaeda instead of white house interns , the complaint even gets more muddy ."
the study of government of states and other political units,"If a small nuclear bomb were to detonate in NYC how many people would die in a 25 miles radius ? I 'm a hs teacher and I 'm trying to develop a lesson plan on the cold war/nuclear proliferation era , and now possible terrorism plot to use a nuke . Too many variables to consider , it 's impossible to answer in this forum . First of all , what do you mean by `` nuclear bomb . '' There are crude nuclear devices , which is called `` dirty bomb . '' A dirty bomb is basically a normal bomb with whole bunch of radioactive waste . The explosion will send the particles into the air , making SOME people die and thousands sick . Also , decontainmenation would be a nightmare and public panic . A small bomb could also be a tactical nuclear device . Those are the so called `` suitcase '' bombs developed during the cold war . They are , for the most part , not very effective . Consider that it 's very heavy and easy to detect by our current sensors in major cities . If your definition of small is something like a `` small '' nuclear missile from states like ... . say Iran/North Korea , then 25 mile radius will pretty much be wasted . That being said , it 's hard to denote a nuclear weapon by terrorist in NYC . For starters , the Dept of Homeland Security has nuclear sensors around critical infrastuctures . Nuclear signatures are VERY easy to detect , esp crude devices that could be used by a terrorist . There are tons of resources for this . But it might be too difficult to explain to high school students.I do n't know what the person below me is saying . First , people in direct vincity of Nagasaki , all 120,000 of them , were VAPORIZED immediately . Second , WWII era nuclear weapons are like nothing of what we have now . A single cold war era multi warhead ICBM missile could destory ALL life in the U.S East Coast . A typical U.S. MIRV has ten sepearte warheads . Do n't think of this as ten different Nagaskais because EACH of those warheads are HUNDREDS of times more powerful than the `` fatman '' dropped on Japan .

Can someone give me a break down as to how this answer is dirived ? Ok ... no probs . The best way to tackle this kind of problem is to keep to one variable , that way it ai n't a variable if you see what I mean . Let lot A = x , then lot B = x + 5000 . If lot C is 5000 more than lot B then lot C = x + 5000 + 5000So lot A = x lot B = x + 5000 lot C = x + 10000The total of this is 3x + 15,000 and this equals 60,000So if 3x + 15,000 =60,000 then 3x = 45,000 so x = 15,000 which , as you can see from the above is lot A.Which shows that the book is correct.To complete the problem B = 15,000 + 5,000 = 20,000 C = 15,000 + 10,000 = 25,00025,000 + 20,000 + 15,000 = 60,000 correct !"

There is no such thing as the perpendicular bisector of a triangle . You can , however , find the perpendicular bisector of any of the three sides of the triangle . Suppose you have a triangle called ABC and you wish to find the perpendicular bisector of the side AB . Simply put the point of a compass at point A and open up the compass so that the pencil end is at point B . Then draw a circle . Now put the point of the compass on point B and the pencil end on point A and draw another circle . The two circles will intersect at two points which you might name E and F. Now draw a line through E and F and passing through AB . This line will be the perpendicular bisector of AB.Every triangle has three altitudes . In the triangle ABC , the line drawn from C perpendicular to the side AB is an altitude , so is the line drawn from B perpedicular to the line AC , and so is the line drawn from A perpendicular to the line BC.The area of a triangle = 1/2 base times altitude . So if you know the area ( A ) and the base ( b ) then altitude = 2A/b.Hope this gives you the info you were looking for ."

a particular branch of scientific knowledge,"An unknown mass falls 4 meters than hits a spring with constant 1000 n/m and compresses 1 meter , what is mass ? the mass falls four meters than hits the spring which compresses another meter before coming to rest ( temporarily ) Friction and air resistance can be ignored . We will assume that air and spring friction is negligible . We will also assume that the mass starts falling with a velocity of zero ( it is n't thrown , for example ) .First , we find the velocity of the mass at the time it strikes the spring . distance = ( 1/2 ) gt^2 so:4 = ( 1/2 ) ( 9.8 ) t^2 , t = 0.90 sec.v = gt = ( 9.8 ) ( 0.90 ) = 8.85 meters/secSo the kinetic energy of the mass when it hits is ( 1/2 ) mv^2 , which is ( 1/2 ) m ( 8.85 ) ^2 or 39.2m Joules.The work done by gravity as the spring compresses is f*d or ( 9.8 ) m ( 1 ) or 9.8m Joules.Next , we need to know the work done by the spring as it compresses . This is the integral of force over distance orInt ( 1000LdL ) . Integrating gives 500 L^2 evaluated from 1 to 0 which is -500 Joules.Finally , we have our equation . The Kinetic energy of the mass is absorbed by the spring , as is the work done by gravity . So we have :39.2m + 9.8m = 50049m = 500m = 10.2 kg ."

a particular branch of scientific knowledge,"what is the mined geologic disposal plan ? When a fuel assembly has been used in a power plant , the assembly is replaced and the old one stored under water in special ponds , or in dry concrete structures or casks . Here , shielded from people , it is allowed to cool.After being sufficiently cooled , the assembly , along with others , is put into a cask for temporary storage on the nuclear power plant site . Delaying the final disposal of high-level waste also allows its radioactivity to decay . Forty years after removal from the reactor , less than one thousandth of its initial radioactivity remains , and it is much easier to handle.The ultimate disposal of vitrified wastes , or of spent fuel assemblies without reprocessing , requires their isolation from the environment for long periods . The most favored method is burial in dry , stable geological formations up to 600 m or more deep . Several countries are investigating sites that would be technically and publicly acceptable.The U.S. considered a number of options for high-level waste disposal , and decided that mined geologic disposal offered the best option for isolation , although research on transmutation of long-lived radionuclides is continuing . Transmutation involving neutron bombardment has the theoretical possibility of removing isotopes that are radioactive for a long time , thus alleviating disposal issues.The plan is that the fuel will eventually be placed in the geologic deep-level repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada . This is a mountain of `` tuff '' -- stable volcanic rock . This site was selected after years of investigation into other rock forms including granite , layered-salt , salt domes , and basalt . All had advantages and all would have provided satisfactory final disposal for high level wastes . The selection of the Yucca Mountain site in Nevada was an expeditious choice based upon the political realities of the day.The repository deep in Yucca Mountain will consist of a large number of tunnels or corridors into which the spent fuel will be placed , in the form of fuel rods . These rods will be sealed in heavy casks of steel , and placed in the mined caverns , which are then sealed with bentonite ( a clay that forms a secure seal ) . The pictures below show what the repository could look like.Artist 's conception of repository underground facilities and operationsArtist 's conception of repository facilitiesHowever , Regulatory bodies have not yet formally approved Yucca Mountain as a high-level waste repository . Also , Congress has not adequately funded the work , even though all necessary funds have already been collected in the Nuclear Waste Fund as a surcharge on the use of electricity ( at 0.1 cent per kWh - for a total of $ 16 billion ) . So , in the meantime , used fuel assemblies are stored temporarily at the power plants in water pools or large dry casks cooled by natural convection.Transuranic WasteWastes arising from weapons production in the Cold War have their own repository at the Waste Isolation Pilot Project ( WIPP ) in New Mexico . This is a repository constructed in layered salt formations and it is been in operation since late 1999 , accepting wastes from Government weapons production sites . The wastes stored there are presently mainly transuranic wastes . This waste has no connection with commercial electricity generation from the nuclear option ."

The similarity between photoelectrochemical cells ( PECs ) and solid state devices is used to model their behaviour and optimize such parameters as band gap , doping level , minority carrier lifetime , etc . A model is presented which calculates the electron affinity of any semiconductor and allows the prediction of the open circuit voltage of wet photovoltaic cells and optimum biasing forchemical producing cells . The effects of absorbed ions at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface are reviewed . The temperature dependence of the energy levels in the semiconductor and the electrolyte are considered and the implications of these results to operation of PECs at elevated temperature are discussed . The major differences between PECs and solid state devices are the stability considerations ."

a particular branch of scientific knowledge,"What is therapeutic cloning ? how does it work ? Therapeutic cloning ( also known as somatic cell nuclear transfer , cell nuclear replacement , research cloning , and embryo cloning ) involves taking an egg ( or oocyte ) from which the nucleus has been removed , and replacing that nucleus with DNA from the cell of another organism . The result is a blastocyst ( an early stage embryo with about 100 cells ) with almost identical DNA to the original organism.The procedure is controversial , and this is reflected in the language used to describe the blastocyst created . Some people believe it should not be called a blastocyst or embryo , since it has not been created by fertilisation , but others maintain that since , given the right conditions , it could still grow into a fetus and eventually a child , it does n't seem misleading to call it an embryo.The aim of carrying out this procedure is to obtain stem cells that are genetically matched to the donor organism . For example , if a person with Parkinson 's disease donated their DNA , then it should be theoretically possible to generate embryonic stem cells that could be used to treat their condition without being rejected by the patient 's immune system ."

a particular branch of scientific knowledge,"Descartes ' Rule of Signs ? I do not understand Descartes ' Rule of Signs , so please help . I am not necessarily looking for the specific answer , but some direction on how to do these types of problems.Use Descartes ' Rule of Signs to determine how many positive and how many negative real zeros the polynomial can have . Then determine the possible total number of real zeros : P ( x ) = 2x^3 - x^2 + 4x -7andP ( x ) = x^8 - x^5 + x^4 - x^3 + x^2 - x + 1 Dascartes rule of signs says that the number of positive roots of a polynomial ( with real coefficients and ordered in descending powers ) is equal to the number of sign changes between consecutive coefficients or is less than that by an exact multiple of 2 ( since double roots are counted twice ) Negative roots are counted by changingthe signs of the coefficients of all odd powers of the variable and counting the sign changes the same as for positive roots.In your first problem there are 3 sign changes so there are 3 positive roots ( one of which may be a repeated root ) . Changing the signs of the x^3 and x terms leads to no sign changes ( all of the coefficients are negative ) so there are no negative roots and the total is 3 roots , all positive.In the 2'nd example , there are 6 sign changes so there are 6 positive roots . Changing the sign of the x^5 , x^3 , and x terms leaves no sign changes so there are no negative roots . Since a polynomial of order n has n roots , there are 8-6 = 2 imaginary or complex roots in the polynomial and 6 real roots ( which may contain repeated roots ) Doug"

a particular branch of scientific knowledge,"How much longer ? Until our sun ( star ) goes supernova ? I love reading about our solar system ! And I love anything to do with space ! When do you think Our sun ( star ) will go supernova ? Our sun will never go supernova . Only the largest stars go supernova ; ours is only about mid-sized . It has been around for about 5 billion years and has an estimated lifespan of 10 billion years . So , you 've got another 5 billion years to relax before the sun 's energy runs out.Having said that , the Earth will not be habitable during that whole period . In about 2 billion years the sun will eject part of its core , becoming a red giant . It will grow dimmer but hotter . While the new outer limit of the sun will only reach out to about Venus 's orbit , the extreme heat will incinerate all life on Earth.After the sun 's lifespan is up , it will collapse back in on itself , forming a white dwarf . It will continue to emit a small amount of energy in this form as it cools down over the next few billion years . After it has cooled it will become a black dwarf , essentially a useless ball of matter.We 're actually lucky to have a mid-sized star . Blue giants only last about a billion years or so ; they are bigger but burn through their fuel *much* faster . Smaller stars do n't last long either ; they are n't big enough to maintain a fusion reaction for very long ."

a particular branch of scientific knowledge,"What scientific process has been used to justify views on the origins of the spieces. ? I am not being a 'Creationist ' smart alec here . My understanding of scientific research is to cover all the bases and challenge all and try to disprove the hypothesis . The `` Missing Link '' dos n't seem to be a phrase suitable for a scientist trying to disprove his hypothesis . Vestigial features ( Note to creationists : vestigial does not mean useless , do not bother lying that it does ) demonstrate we are not now what we were in our past . Our descending testes is a vestige of our reptilian days . Our quadraped-style backs demonstrate we used to walk on four-legs and are only imperfectly adapted yet to two.Each and every human on the planet has a gene that would stimulate our hair growth to be as thick as a chimpanzee 's , if it were working . It 's broken because it has a parasite in it . Remove the parasite and we 'd have nice , thick coating of fur . Evolution explains this easily , we evolved from furry ancestors , the parasite is responsible for our current state . Creationism has no explanation for why God would have created us with a broken gene , with a parasite , neither of which we actually want.One gene we do want is a Vitamin C gene . Untold masses of people have died throughout history due to lacking a way to make their own vitamin C. But , we do have one . It 's just broken . Our primate ancestors lived in fruit rich environments , making their own vitamin C was an unnecessary waste of energy , so a mutation killing the gene was a good thing . Humans do *not* always live in such areas and a vitamin C gene would have saved many , many lives . But instead , we have one broken , broken in EXACTLY the same way that a chimpanzee 's is broken . Why were we created wtih a broken vitamin C gene ? Why is it broken *exactly* the same way as a chimp 's ? Still no answer from the creationists.The evidence for evolution comes from all directions all the time . The fossils demand evoluion , creationists being unable to explain any aspects of fossils sorting . Biogeography demands evolution . How , after the Flood , did all the animals manage to get back to the areas where their fossils are ? Why would they bother ? Where are the signs of the massive forest of eucalyptus it would take to get koala from the Ark back to Australia ? Scientists can piece together the motion of the continents from species distribution , creationists are left only with pretending it is n't enough.As far as the `` missing '' link goes , this is primarily a press bugaboo . There is no singular missing link . Rather , we have a wide series of very non-missing links . Classic case in point : http : //www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/compare.htmlHere you can see a list of some of the fossil skulls scientists claim are links between humans and the rest of the apes . Creationists have to pretend that there are no transitions , each of those fossils is either `` obviously '' human or `` obviously '' ape . But when you look at what they say is `` obviously '' what , you 'll see they can not even agree on which skulls are `` obviously '' which . If it was really obvious , would n't they agree ? Would n't they come *close* to agreeing ? The only thing obvious about that chart is that the skulls really do seem to be transitional and creationist demands for a supposedly missing link are nothing but the equivalent of sticking one 's fingers in one 's ears and yelling , `` DOES NOT '' to make the evidence go away ."

Not to sound anti-Christian or anything like that , but it is my belief , through reading about and listening to Christians and their Bible ( s ) , that in reality , you are still Jewish . The only reason you left the term `` Jewish-Christian '' was because the deciples got angry when the leaders of the regular Jewish sects denounced the Jewish-Christian followers for believing that Christ was the messiah . You know what , I 'm jewish , and i think it could be possible for Jesus to be the Messiah . Not the actual human that lived 2000 years ago , but the sense that anyone can be the messiah.Also , If any of you were woundering . Jesus cant be the jewish messiah .

an extended social group having a distinctive cultural and economic organization,"what is the origin of life ? Research into the origin of life is a limited field of research despite its profound impact on biology and human understanding of the natural world . Progress in this field is generally slow and sporadic , though it still draws the attention of many due to the gravity of the question being investigated . A few facts give insight into the conditions in which life may have emerged , but the mechanisms by which non-life became life are still elusive.For the observed evolution of life on earth , see the timeline of life.Research into the origin of life is the modern incarnation of the ancient concept of abiogenesis . Abiogenesis , in its most general sense , is the generation of life from non-living matter . The term is primarily used in the context of biology and the origin of life . Abiogenesis was long considered to be a very common occurrence until the Law of Biogenesis ( omne vivum ex ovo or `` all life from an egg '' ) became firmly established in modern biology as a result of the work of Louis Pasteur.Charles Darwin in a letter to J.D . Hooker of February 1st 1871 , made the suggestion that life may have begun in a `` warm little pond , with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts , lights , heat , electricity , etc . present , that a protein compound was chemically formed ready to undergo still more complex changes , at the present day such matter would be instantly devoured or absorbed , which would not have been the case before living creatures were formed . '' Thus , it is the presence of life itself , operating in an oxygen rich atmosphere , itself a product of life , which prevents `` spontaneous generation '' from occurring on Earth today.This modern definition of abiogenesis is concerned with the formation of the simplest forms of life from primordial chemicals , in an environment regarded as similar to that at the time shortly after the formation of the Earth . This is significantly different from the concept of Aristotelian abiogenesis , which postulated the formation of complex organisms . This article reviews different hypotheses for modern abiogenetic processes that are currently under debate.There is no truly `` standard '' model of the origin of life , however most currently accepted models build in one way or another upon a number of discoveries concerning the origin of molecular and cellular components for life , which are listed in a rough order of postulated emergence : Plausible pre-biotic conditions result in the creation of certain basic small molecules ( monomers ) of life , such as amino acids . This was demonstrated in the Urey-Miller experiment by Stanley L. Miller and Harold C. Urey in 1953 . Phospholipids ( of an appropriate length ) can spontaneously form lipid bilayers , one of the two basic components of a cell membrane . The polymerization of nucleotides into random RNA molecules might have resulted in self-replicating ribozymes ( RNA world hypothesis ) . Selection pressures for catalytic efficiency and diversity result in ribozymes which catalyse peptidyl transfer ( hence formation of small proteins ) , since oligopeptides complex with RNA to form better catalysts . Thus the first ribosome is born , and protein synthesis becomes more prevalent . Proteins outcompete ribozymes in catalytic ability , and therefore become the dominant biopolymer . Nucleic acids are restricted to predominantly genomic use . The origin ( see Origin of organic molecules ) of the basic biomolecules , while not settled , is less controversial than the significance and order of steps 2 and 3 . The basic inorganic chemicals from which life was formed are methane ( CH4 ) , ammonia ( NH3 ) , water ( H2O ) , hydrogen sulfide ( H2S ) , carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , and phosphate ( PO43- ) . As of 2004 , no one has yet synthesized a `` protocell '' using basic components which has the necessary properties of life ( the so-called `` bottom-up-approach '' ) . Without such a proof-of-principle , explanations have tended to be short on specifics"

an extended social group having a distinctive cultural and economic organization,"when did it become customary for people to applaud to show approval or appreciation for a performance ? OK , Seester , you asked for it ! The custom of applauding is doubtless as old and as widespread as humanity , and the variety of its forms is limited only by the capacity for devising means of making a noise . Among civilized nations , however , it has at various times been subject to certain conventions . Thus the Romans had a set ritual of applause for public performances , expressing degrees of approval : snapping the finger and thumb , clapping with the flat or hollow palm , waving the flap of the toga , for which last the emperor Aurelian substituted a handkerchief ( orarium ) , distributed to all Roman citizens ( see Stole ) . In the theatre , at the close of the play , the chief actor called out `` Valete et plaudite ! `` , and the audience , guided by an unofficial choregus , chaunted their applause antiphonally . This was often organized and paid for ( Böttiger , Über das Applaudieren im Theater bei den Alten , Leipz. , 1822 ) .When Christianity became fashionable the customs of the theatre were transferred to the churches . Eusebius ( Hist . Eccl . vii . 30 ) says that Paul of Samosata encouraged the congregation to applaud his preaching by waving linen cloths ( οθοναις ) , and in the 4th and 5th centuries applause of the rhetoric of popular preachers had become an established custom.Though , however , applause may provide a healthy stimulus , its abuse has led to attempts at abolishing or restricting it even in theatres . The institution of the claque , people hired by performers to applaud them , has largely discredited the custom , and indiscriminate applause has been felt as an intolerable interruption to serious performances . The reverential spirit which abolished applause in church has tended to spread to the theatre and the concert-room , largely under the influence of the quasi-religious atmosphere of the Wagner performances at Baireuth . In Germany ( e.g . the court theatres at Berlin ) applause during the performance and `` calling before the curtain '' have been officially forbidden , but even in Germany this is felt to be in advance of public opinion.In most western countries , audience members clap their hands at random to produce a constant noise ; however , it tends to synchronize naturally to a weak degree . As a form of mass nonverbal communication , it is a simple indicator of the average relative opinion of the entire group ; the louder and longer the noise , the stronger the sign of approval . In other cultures , audiences clap rhythmically in unison , about two claps per second , to indicate approval . Clapping in unison might also , however , be understood as disapproval , and an insult to the performer . During musical events , it is common for an audience to clap in the rythm of the song , to cheer the artists present on stage.Famous performers , as well as celebrities in other fields such as politics , may also receive applause when they first appear on stage , before they deliver a speech or their first speaking part . This accolade given in response to his or her past achievements and is not a reflection of the performance the audience is attending.On some occasions , applause can also occur in the middle of an event . The President of the United States , in his State of the Union address , is often interrupted by applause ; in fact , tracking the number of such interruptions has become a trend for various television news channels . It is often customary for jazz performers to receive applause in the middle of a tune , after completing an improvisational solo section.The phrase `` slow clap '' usually refers to the tentative beginning of applause , especially in American movies from the 1980s ( as parodied in Not Another Teen Movie ) . It derived its dramatic usefulness as an indicator of a shift between public scorn and public praise . But at other times the slow clap could be considered insulting or ironic . ( PS Thanks Dr . Dan ! )"

an extended social group having a distinctive cultural and economic organization,"In Boston , public anger has still not abated in the high-profile case of Cardinal Bernard Law , ... . ? who acknowledged that as long as 18 years ago he made `` wrong decisions '' in keeping a pedophile priest in parish work . ( See his letter to the archdiocese at the ZENIT Web page < http : //www.zenit.org/english/ > . ) Within a year of arriving as archbishop of Boston in 1984 , Law had shuffled Father John J. Geoghan to another parish , even though the prelate was aware that the priest had been abusing children for years . After abusing more children , Geoghan was removed for treatment , but then reassigned -- only to continue his preying on youngsters . Court allegations say he abused 130 or more children before defrocked in 1998 . Cardinal Law has refused to resign over the case . `` My resignation is not part of the solution as I see it , '' he told a group of more than 500 priests at a conference Jan. 23 in Boston . `` I want the archdiocese to become a model for how this issue should be handled . '' Yes , the whole situation in Boston was terrible . The bottom line of it was : Cardinal Law acted like a business manager , or a lawyer , or someone else whose primary goal was nothing but damage control.He did n't act like an apostle . That 's why he listened to psychotherapists who pronounced Geoghan and other abusive priests `` cured '' when they definitely were not `` cured '' and never would be.It 's why he listened to lawyers and insurance providers who advised him to make secret financial settlements while shuffling abusive priests from parish to parish.It 's why he capitulated to society 's politically correct view of homosexuality -- and allowed known gay priests to continue to sexually prey NOT on young kids , but older boys past the age of puberty.Plenty of blame can be passed around here -- on the psychotherapists , lawyers , insurance guys , apathetic laity , and on a politically correct culture that sees nothing wrong with the homosexuality that was displayed by the vast majority of priests guilty in this scandal.But at the end of the day , the archdiocese of Boston was run by Law . He handled this situation very poorly . I have no doubt that the Church has learned a very hard lesson , and will not let the errors of the past be repeated -- by returning to its orthodox roots ."

The bible doesnt count , because it was written by humans and if so why does the bible differ . between religions.Secondly , why are there different religions if theres 1 god , supposedly . Each religion proposes no proof that there religion is better than any others that I have heard about.Third , why do people who are strong `` believers '' always try to force you and push you to convert to there religion ? Forth , why in the `` bible '' does it support men only . I mean if he created us , he would have made us more equal in the bible ( if it was written by a holy being ) Because there is no ultimate proof that was written by one.I was watchin Pen & Tellers : Bull $ hit , and they had a episode on this general topic . And i agree on a most of wat they said , if ya have seen it include too ... You ask big questions , and lots of em ! I 'd like to first say that the disagreement is about whether God exists or not . There are different terms regarding peoples ' views on the existence of God : Theist - a person who BELIEVES in a god or godsAtheist - a person who does not believe in a god or godsAgnostic - a person who does not KNOW if there is a god or godsGnostic - an old term for an ancient religion of people who claimed to have a special way of knowing god.When viewed objectively every person is agnostic . That is , every person is the same - no person KNOWS whether there is a god or not . Of course , many theists think that they KNOW god is real , but actually it is just a very strong belief that they have , not knowledge.The entire argument here is really between theists and atheists - people who believe in god ( s ) and people who do n't believe in god ( s ) . Since no one is able to know with certainty whether there is a god or not , all people are in fact agnostic ( that is , they do not KNOW whether there is a god or not ) , although very few admit it.All people are actually agnostic . Some people are atheist . Most people are theist . It 's an interesting question : why do most people believe in something that no one knows ? When you think about aliens ( ETs or UFOs ) most people do n't believe in them , at least not fervently . Maybe a few `` oddballs '' do , but they are generally dismissed for believing fervently in something that they just have no way of knowing . Not so with religion , and god ( s ) .So the question is : what evidence is there to support a belief in god ( s ) ? And more to the point , why do people believe , and often believe fervently , in god ( s ) when the available `` evidence '' is : A ) insufficientB ) often contradicted by scienceC ) often logically unsoundHere are some answers to some of your questions : QUESTION ONE '' My opinion on the subject is how can God exist if theres no physical proof he ever existed ? `` Well , perhaps we just do n't have the technology to detect his existence , perhaps things do exist that we have yet to detect . Atoms have always existed , but until we had sophisticated microscopes we did not know it , and could not prove it , but some people did theorize that they existed.QUESTION TWO '' Secondly , why are there different religions if theres 1 god , supposedly . `` Why are there different countries ? Well , the answer is geography , people are separated from other people , people in certain areas become one country , people in another area become another country . Likewise , if there is a god who `` reveals himself '' to people in one country , they may have different stories to tell than a god who reveals himself in some other far away country , but it could be the same god ! QUESTION THREE '' Third , why do people who are strong `` believers '' always try to force you and push you to convert to there religion ? `` That is a good question , which is connected to why most people are theists and also connected to why a large number of people are fervent believers despite the lack of evidence . This could take a long time to give a thorough answer.The primary reason that believers push their beliefs on others is because they are insecure . Another word for insecurity is fear . They are afraid of the world around them , and wish to control it as much as they can , in order to make themselves feel more secure . Actually the primary reason people believe in religions ( or why they believe the beliefs they push on others ) is their fear , too , and the same fear that causes them to believe what they do causes them to push their beliefs on others . People are afraid of mortality - they do n't like ( and very much fear ) the idea that they will cease to exist , so they create complicated stories ( mythologies , religions ) that if they believe in it , assures them that they wo n't actually cease to exist -"

an extended social group having a distinctive cultural and economic organization,"What is the difference between pagans and wiccans ? Pagan : A follower of a nature-based religion . It is important to remember that all Wiccans are pagan , but not all pagans are Wiccan . There is a very wide variety of pagan religions , Wicca is just one of them . POLYTHEISM - The belief that all of the various deities are separate and distinct individuals PANTHEISM- The belief in a single deity exhibiting aspects_ a composite or sum of the self-ware universe MONOTHEISM- Holds that there is only one deity with a singular aspect & usually places the universe as a product of that deity rather than a part of it . There are many types of witchcraft , many of which overlap and all of which can be defined in different ways by different people , but here are some rough guidelines for their designations : African witchcraft : There are many type of witchcraft in Africa . The Azande of central Africa believe that witchcraft causes all types of misfortune . The `` gift '' of witchcraft , know as mangu , is passed from parent to child . Those possessing mangu are n't even aware of it and perform magick unconsciously while they sleep . Appalachian Folk Magic : Those who practice witchcraft in the Appalachian mountains see good and evil as two distinct forces that are lead by the Christian God and Devil , respectively . They believe there are certain conditions that their magick can not cure . They also believe that witches are blessed with paranormal powers and can perform powerful magick that can be used for either good or evil purposes . They look to nature for omens and portents of the future . Green witchcraft : A Green witch is very similar to a Kitchen/Cottage witch ( see below ) with the exception that the Green witch practices in the fields and forest in order to be closer to the Divine spirit . The Green witch makes his or her own tools from accessible materials from outdoors . Hedge witchcraft : A Hedge witch is not part of a group or coven . This witch practices magick alone and works more with the green arts , herbal cures and spells . In the early days , Hedge witches were local wise men or women who cured illnesses and gave advice . They can be of any religion and are considered traditional witches ( see below ) . Hereditary witchcraft : Hereditary witches believe in `` gifts '' of the craft that are with a witch from birth , having been passed from generations before . Hoodoo/Conjure/Root witchcraft : Hoodoo is a type of African-American folk magic that combines African folkloric practices and beliefs with American Indian botanical knowledge and European folklore . Hoodoo uses the magical properties of herbs , roots , minerals ( especially the lodestone ) , animal parts and the personal possessions and body fluids of people . Kitchen/Cottage witchcraft : A Kitchen witch , or Cottage witch , practices magick around the hearth and home . The home is a sacred place , and the use of herbs is used often to bring protection , prosperity and healing . Kitchen witches often follow more than one path of witchcraft . Luciferian witchcraft : Luciferianism is often mistaken for Satanism because it is the worship of the deity named Lucifer , but Luciferian magick is used for both good and bad . Pennsylvania Dutch hexcraft or `` Pow-wow '' : When the Germans first arrived in Pennsylvania , Native Americans were there , so the term `` pow-wow '' to describe this practice may come from observations of Indian gatherings . Pow-wowing includes charms and incantations dating back to the Middle Ages , as well as elements borrowed from the Jewish Kabbalah and Christian Bible . Pow-wowing focuses on healing illnesses , protecting livestock , finding love or casting or removing hexes . Pow-wowers consider themselves to be Christians endowed with supernatural powers . Traditional witchcraft : Traditional witchcraft often follows science , history and the arts as its foundation . While sharing the same respect for nature as the Wiccan witch ( see below ) , traditional witches do not worship natu"

Edit : I did ask this in the Business section , but I think only black people were answering the question , since the answers were a little race-biased . Having a black family in your neighborhood will not bring anyone 's neighborhood value down . Sadly enough , usually when a black family moves in , you will find out who the biggest bigot is first . Because they will be the first to leave . By you being 17 years old , you have a chance to educate yourself and not fall prey to ignorance . Sadly enough , these people are the first to enter the church on Sundays .

an active diversion requiring physical exertion and competition,"who should i draft 1st in fantasy baseball ? baseball , fanatsy sports , Depends on the setup of the league - what stats are they counting , what is the draft like ? Both players put up similar numbers , with Pujols on one hand consistently having more doubles and fewer strikeouts , and on the other , consistently getting a few less RBI 's , HR , and SB than Rodriguez.There will probably be fewer RBI chances on the Cardinals than the Yankees , but Pujols is younger and is just entering his prime rather than perching on the tail end of it.Another factor : there are fewer impact 3B than there are impact 1B . In a six-team league , take Pujols . In a 12+ team , you might want to grab the best player at a somewhat difficult position to fill in ARod ."

an active diversion requiring physical exertion and competition,"Who should the 49ers draft in the 1st round of the 2006 NFL draft ? I would like to hear who you think , and why ? If you think they should trade , what should the trade be ? Keep in mind they have both the 6th pick and the 22nd pick From everything ive been reading the 49ers have two players that are their top picks , AJ Hawk from The Ohio State and Mario Williams NC State . There have also been reports that their reasoning for trading theit second and third round picks with Denver was to position themselves to move up to the top 3 , the thinking would be that Williams and Hawk will both be gone at 6 . But for the question asked I 'll assume they stay put.For the 6th pick Id go with Michael Huff . Its really a bit of a reach at this high a pick , but I believe that his versatiltiy of playing either corner or saftey in the NFL would benefit the very thin defensive backfield of the 49ers . As for the 22nd pick , it would be ideal if either WR Santonio Holmes of The OSU or Chad Jackson from Florida were available to select one of them . Another option ive been hearing of lately would be DE/OLB Manny Lawson , but any 49er fan knows that the offense is miles behind the defense in every aspect ."

Walk the dog is a trick where you are basically using the tennis ball like a basketball bouncing it between your legs as you walk . Spinning the racket on your finger is self explanitory . Catching a ball in mid flight without a bounce requires you to catch and cradle the ball as you turn the racket over while decelerating the ball in harmony with the take back of your racket . Throwing your racket in the air spinning fast and catching the handle a la Hicham Arazi the magician , is the best I have ever seen at this . Also there is spinning the racket around your neck and onto your other hand , which is very difficult and I have only known a couple of players that could do it .

an active diversion requiring physical exertion and competition,"how can i hit my tennis forehand with top spin ? please tell in simple words . Starting with the grip : You probably want to use a 'Semi-Western ' or a 'Western ' forehand grip . Essentially you want to hold the racquet as you would a frying pan , making sure you grip it at the very bottom of the grip.The swing : To start you racket head wants to be back and lower than where you want to make contact with the ball , keep your arm reasonably close to your side.Contact with the ball is the most imporant part of the swing , the 'contact point ' wants to be in front of your body , idealy at around net height , your racket heads wants to be pressing forwards and up.To finnish the shot you want to keep your eyes on where you made contact with the ball , your racket head finnishes up high over your shoulder and your hips and shoulders should be 'squared ' to the net.To really learn a top spin forehand you want to get on a tennis court with someone that can either teach you , or knows how to hit one and you can watch their technique.Players like Rafael Nadal hit with alot of topspin so I would recommend you watch him play on TV if you have the chance , and Roger Federer is awesome and everyone can try and learn from him ."

Everyday I see people with clubs they purchased at a great price put they ca n't hit them . You need a 3 wood and a sandwedge The sandwedge bounce is the key . Find one you can hit out of the grass and sand . You can get a sandwedge for little money . You can always upgrade down the road .

You may want to talk to previous cheerleaders and learn a few cheers so you can have a head start . Memorizing all the arm/leg movements and words can be hard all at one time . You might also want to make up your own cheers to help you memory , but make them challenging ! 4 ) Be time flexable ! Make sure you can make it to all the games , and all the practices . Missing too many may result in being kicked off the team.5 ) Be strong ! If you are n't the lightest person on the team , you will have to spot others .

He ran the 100m at the olympics bac in 1940 's or 1950 's Ira James Murchison ( February 6 , 1933 - March 28 , 1994 ) was an American athlete , winner of the gold medal in 4x100 m relay at the 1956 Summer Olympics.Born in Chicago , Illinois , Ira Murchison was noted for his exceptional speed from the starting block , which earned him a nickname Human Sputnik.Before the Melbourne Olympics , Murchison equalled twice the 100 m world record of 10.2 and ran in Berlin a new world record of 10.1 , thus becoming one of the favourites to win the 100 m Olympic gold medal . But at Melbourne , Murchison managed to finish only in a disappointing fourth place . He also ran the leadoff leg of the 4x100 m relay team for the United States , and helped the American team to a gold medal in a world record time of 39.5.In 1957 , Murchison repeated the 100 yd world record of 9.3 and , as a Western Michigan University student , won the 1958 NCAA championships in 100 yd . At the 1963 Pan American Games , Murchison finished third in the 100 m and helped the American 4x100 m relay team to win a gold medal.Ira Murchison died in Harvey , Illinois , aged 61 ."

an active diversion requiring physical exertion and competition,"Who will win the 2006 Ashes and why ? Who or what strategy will bring their country to glory ? I think it will be a tough and gritty series for both teams . Having said that , England will be suffering for the lack of Simon Jones and Michael Vaughan , who were both key players last time . Also , the late loss of Tresco will damage their chances . Australia is a tough tour , and the hard pitches have a habit of taking their toll on visiting bowlers . Harmison and Flintoff are both recovering from injuries , but will need to bowl long spells which could take their toll.However , the England team are young and enthusiastic , which will give them plenty of determination . They also have plenty of talent in KP , Flintoff , Strauss etc.Australia though , I feel , have just too much experience . Yourself , and Hayden , when you two get going build awesome platforms for the team to go onto big totals . Punter is in the best form of his life and has scored 1483 runs at 78 including 8 tons since the Ashes . If he gets going , We should be scoring 500+ scores . Then Hussey , well what a talent . Marto has a doubt but with Clarke and Jacques both pressing for a spot the middle should fire more than last year . Gilchrist does n't even need a mention , except to say that Englands strategy of bowling around the wicket and moving it away should n't work as well in Oz as the extra bounce should give his the chance to cut and pull more often , which we all know he does with devestating effect . Brett Lee , McGrath and Warney will all fire up and do the job , and whoever gets the nod out of Watson , Clark , Tait or Johnson will be very keen to impress , and with the benefit of the extra bounce at home , the youngsters should bowl fast , and make life tough for England 's inexperienced batsmen.I think it will be closer than a lot of people back home will be thinking . I think the home crowds , and the conditions will just be a little too much for such a young inexperienced England team . Do n't worry , there are plenty of Aussies over here in London who will be sitting up late at night and cheering you boys along , and we are taking the stick from the Poms for you , so get stuck in , good luck , and here 's to a summer of runs for you boys.Aus to win 2-1 ."

Sounds like you know what you want already , so check out the various brands , and find out what they have in your price range , then go to the shops and test ride the ones you are interested in.If you want to ride off road make sure your tyres are n't too slick.I would n't think that a road bike is particularly comfortable by the way , since it 's primary concern is speed , it 's designed for a riding posture that minimises air resistance , with your spine leant a long way forward , for comfort you need a bike that allows an upright spine.Also if your thinking of riding down anything particularly steep off road , I would reccomend making sure the frame shape allows the seet to be lowered quite a lot . So that you can shift your weight back a lot , and also so you can jump off the back easily if you need toAlso tell the people at the bike shop what sort of riding you intend to do they would be able to give you further advice ."
an active diversion requiring physical exertion and competition,"can a player change which country he wants to play for in the world cup ? for example if he were born in england and played for england but his parents were born in france and brazil could he then choose to play for france or brazil or does he have to stay with england ? ( all examples ) This is the FIFA rule regarding your question . This rule came into force on 1 January 2004.Up his 21st birthday , a player who has represented an Association team ( Country ) in one or more matches of an official competition may henceforth request to change the Association for which he is eligible , provided that he fulfils the following criteria : - he has not played at “ A ” international level for the Association for which he is eligible at the time he submitted the request ; - he had dual nationality ( or more than two nationalities ) , at the time of his first appearance in an international match in an official competition of any category . Therefore , this provision does not apply to any players who have been naturalised after having already represented one Association . Consequently , FIFA has rejected the request submitted by Murat Mogomedov , a Russian player but now a naturalised Israeli , as he has already played for Russia.Any player who fulfils the above criteria may only once request to change the Association for which he is eligible ."
an active diversion requiring physical exertion and competition,"Who is the greatest all around baseball player of all time ? It depends on how you define `` greatest '' . Would Babe Ruth be a great ballplayer in 2006 ? He 'd probably be nothing special . Today 's players benefit from nutritional guidance , weight lifting and fitness programs , better travel conditions , and countless other things that players from Ruth 's era could never have dreamed of . ( Not to mention illegal pharmaceutical additives , in some cases . ) Ruth also played in an 8 team league ( I believe it was 8 ) , so instead of the 600 best baseball players , he only played against 200 . Higher quality players.On the other hand , players of Ruth 's era only played against white ballplayers ; there were no blacks , Hispanics , Asians , or other ethnic groups or foreigners playing in baseball . One could argue that that diminished the quality of the game . Perhaps the quantity of players and the lack of mixed ethnicity cancel each other out . We 'll never know.To me , Ruth is the greatest , though Mays and DiMaggio and several others are certainly in contention . Ruth is the greatest because of what he did in comparison to the other players of his day . He did n't just break records by a 5 or 6 % , he broke them by doubling the old record . He 'd hit as many home runs in a season as entire other teams.And by that definition he was head , shoulders , chest , and waist above the other players of his era . To me that makes him the best.In addition , he was larger than life . He brought a lot of good attention to the game , and is probably to a degree responsible for the success of the game over the last 100 years . I am not sure you can say that about any particular players who followed him.But there are valid arguments for Willie Mays , Yogi Berra , Joe DiMaggio , Ted Williams , and others . That 's what 's great about baseball ; there is no right answer. -- Cloyd"

an active diversion requiring physical exertion and competition,"Who knows a good athltes book ? I have Mind Gym and Hockey Tough ? I am a good hockey player , but i want to have a lot of resources to be the best that i can . While books can be a valuable source of information , why not locate instructional videos ? They are even more helpful , in that you can see the entire technique that 's demonstrated ( whether it be skating , shooting , defensive play , checking , and even conditioning ) . I 'm sure the internet has a large number of hockey store sites that you can peruse . As a former hockey coach , I have a collection of both instructional hockey books and VCR 's , and I tended to favor the tapes for getting tips on technique improvement.As for the mental aspect of playing , I think that reading about successful players ( and how they got to be successful ) will be helpful to you - I 'm sure the common denominator in all their stories will be hard work , talent , and more hard work . Take stock of your strengths and weaknesses , and focus on improving your weaknesses . Find someone who is knowledgable , like a player or coach , to help you with your training . And do n't underestimate conditioning ... .make sure you get in proper playing shape . Off-ice training is a very important aspect of conditioning for hockey . Good luck ."
