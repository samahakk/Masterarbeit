joy,"In the morning when he awoke, he began to search over hill and dale for this pretty flower; and eight long days he sought for it in vain: but on the ninth day, early in the morning, he found the beautiful purple flower; and in the middle of it was a large dewdrop, as big as a costly pearl."

joy,Jorindel was very glad indeed to see this.
surprise,"Then he touched the door with the flower, and it sprang open; so that he went in through the court, and listened when he heard so many birds singing."
joy,"He ran or flew after her, touched the cage with the flower, and Jorinda stood before him, and threw her arms round his neck looking as beautiful as ever, as beautiful as when they walked together in the wood."
joy,"Then he touched all the other birds with the flower, so that they all took their old forms again; and he took Jorinda home, where they were married, and lived happily together many years: and so did a good many other lads, whose maidens had been forced to sing in the old fairys cages by themselves, much longer than they liked."
